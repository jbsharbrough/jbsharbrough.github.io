<p>My second composition assignment at UNT was to write a baritone
quartet.&nbsp; This piece was difficult because they made me find some musicians
to play it and I learned about the great gap between thinking about music in my
mind and making it here on earth.&nbsp; Musicians have very little time to
rehearse, the more of them you need the less their schedule will match, and the
good ones have even less time than the bad ones.</p>
<p>I'm grateful for the efforts of the volunteers who played this piece in
recital on 9 Dec 1995 at North Texas.</p>

<p>My goal in writing the piece was to try to capture &quot;natural&quot;
rhythms, and to contrast them with steady musical rhythms.&nbsp; I chose as my
theme Milner Pass, a place in Rocky Mountain National Park where one is
surrounded by mountains and forests.&nbsp; I have enjoyed hiking there with my
wife Susan and my friends Dale and Victoria LeMaster.&nbsp; I thought of ants
and elk and critters in between.&nbsp; I thought of mountains and big
spaces.&nbsp; Maybe you'll hear them.</p>
