<p>At Brookhaven, I took a composition class from Elaine Gardner-Morales.&nbsp;
The class assignment was to write three one-minute piano pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the second one, I wanted to do something unusual with tonal centers.&nbsp; This
piece is based on a theme that I used back in 1976, but not so you'd know it.</p>
<p>There are words for this piece.</p>
<u>
<p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Holy, Holey, Wholly<br>
</font></u><font face="Courier New" size="2">I have these two sides. We live in
here. One’s a sinner, one’s a saint. I want to be the one who loves you. The
one who’d never want to be above you. The one who thinks you’re holy.<br>
<br>
I’ve said it one time, I’ve said it twice. I never plan to fall in love. It
tears my tears out on the wrong day … It leaves me feeling spent and empty. It
leaves me feeling holey.<br>
<br>
I live these two lives, at different times. Sometimes I try so hard to believe.
I want to be the one who trusts you. The one who jumps off the house above you.
The one who thinks you’re holy.<br>
<br>
I can’t trust women. I can’t love men. Where does a problem like this end? I
watch you want the things that I do. I watch you want them deep inside you. I
watch you take them, wholly.<br>
<br>
I live these two lives, at different times. Sometimes I try not to believe that
you’re the one who’d try to hurt me, that you’re the one who’d ever
desert me, that you’re the one who’s holy.</font></p>
<p>It was performed instrumentally in recital by Cakewalk 6.0 during December 1997.</p>
