<p><font size="1">©1998 Beau Sharbrough</font></p>
<p>At Brookhaven, I took a composition class from Elaine Gardner-Morales.&nbsp;
The class assignment was to write three one-minute piano pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first one, I started with a simple lullaby that I used to sing to the
girls when they were little and cried a lot:</p>
<p>All the little girls go by,<br>
And all the little boys say hi,<br>
And all they wanna know's why<br>
All the little girls seem to<br>
Ever want to do is cry.</p>
<p>It was nonsense, that's the point.</p>
<p>The piece has three sections.&nbsp; The first is a lyrical pass at it.&nbsp;
The second is the Magic Phone Number for root movement by 5th, with a borrowed
chord thrown in for good measure.&nbsp; The third part is like the first one,
but with a different feeling.&nbsp; I broke the measures into front half and
back half and did different things in each half.</p>
<p>It was performed in recital by Cakewalk 6.0 during December 1997.</p>
