<p>My first composition assignment at North Texas was to write a simple piece that got me
away from my rock roots by avoiding beats and keys.</p>

<p>My instructor, Edilberto Cuellar, suggested that I listen to Debussy's Whole Tone scale
to see what he had in mind.&nbsp; In listening to Debussy's piano etude &quot;Veils,&quot;
it occurred to me that I could use that scale and try to present some conflict.</p>

<p>I also have this pet idea that music can be made to imitate human speech more closely.
&nbsp; I like it when the muted trumpets on the cartoons go &quot;wah wah wah wah&quot; as
the thing sags and falls over.&nbsp; I try to listen to the melody in everyday speech and
play with it in melodies.&nbsp; I'm not claiming that it works, but it was a goal of mine
in this composition.</p>

<p>The basic story is a meeting in the woods between Red Riding Hood and the Wolf.
&nbsp; The violin is Red, except when it's the woods.&nbsp; The piano is the wolf, except
when it's the woods, too.&nbsp; Some of the wolf's lines satisfy me in my effort to make
them sound expressive, like when people talk.</p>

<p>The basic idea is an easy one -- the wolf always lies, there's already a fundamental
conflict for Red to avoid being eaten, for the innocent to remain so, for the Destroyer to
go destroy some other place.&nbsp; Enjoy the music.</p>

<p>I should add that I have never gotten the violin samples to sound the way I want them,
but I endure it because it's all I can do.</p>
