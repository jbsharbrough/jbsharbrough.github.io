<p>At Brookhaven, I took a composition class from Elaine Gardner-Morales.&nbsp;
The class assignment was to write three one-minute piano pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the third one, I wanted to do something unusual with rhythms.&nbsp; This
piece is based on a theme that I used back in 1983.&nbsp; I wanted to make a
really steady beat, to break up the sustained notes into a series of the same
note, for example.</p>
<p>The title is a joke, a takeoff on the complaint by people that their wives
don't understand them.&nbsp; I think that my wife understood me very well.&nbsp;
On the other hand, I don't think that I did.</p>
<p>It was performed instrumentally in recital by Cakewalk 6.0 during December 1997.</p>
