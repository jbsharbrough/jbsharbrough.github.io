        of topics.</p>
      <h2> 
        
        Taxpayer ripoff #1: Baseball contraction 
        
        </h2>
      <p>Bud Lite, as baseball fans refer to Bud Selig, the faux commissioner 
        of baseball, is talking about contraction of baseball teams. Two of them. 
        Most people pick on the Expos and the Marlins. Some people want to see 
        the Devil Rays go. Bud is talking about buying out the Twinkies (that's 
        the Minnesota Twins for those of you who don't follow the game). Bud Lite 
        is the worst thing to happen to baseball, ever. Worse than the Black Sox. 
        Worse than Pete Rose. The current crop of MLB owners will ruin a perfectly 
        good pair of leagues, and lose money in a legal monopoly.</p>
      <p>The plans being bandied about by the airheads like Peter Gammons indicate 
        that the owners plan to buy out two teams for $200 million each, that 
        it's about $15 million per owner and that they've got the money in the 
        bank. Some of the stories involve Disney selling the Angels, and several 
        owners playing fruit basket turnover.</p>
      <p>How can I accuse Bud Lite of being bad? The Twins, Bud? The team closest 
        to the team that you used to own and now your daughter runs for you? Close 
        them down because they have a bad stadium lease? And because their owner 
        wants out? I'm accusing Bud of trying to line his own pocket at the expense 
        of the people of Milwaukee and the people of Minneapolis / St Paul. What 
        a travesty for him to call himself a commissioner, after Fay Vincent, Bart 
        Giammatti, Bowie Kuhn, and Judge Landis had the job. He's a used car salesman, 
        and a bad person for suggesting that the Twins are a problem.</p>
      <p>If the other owners can buy out Carl Pohlad for $200 million, why can't 
        they spend $100 million and get the Twins a new stadium deal? They Twins 
        are subletting from the Vikings at the Humpdome, and they have the worst 
        lease in baseball. Their team wins, the franchise is 100 years old (they 
        were the old Washington Senators until about 1962), and its only mistake 
        was being weak and in Bud's back yard. The ghost of Walter Johnson is 
        going to throw more than a dollar across the Potomac.</p>
      <p>If there were any cities for the teams to move to, they would be doing 
        that fraudulicious taxpayer stickup. Give us a $200 million stadium or we'll 
        leave for another city that will. How can they get more cities to move 
        to? Close down a couple of teams. And wait, why do you need another city? 
        Just threaten to buy them out when they don't yield to extortion. </p>
      <p>This contraction idea might be a great idea, but the guys who are cooking 
        it up are scamming for money, not husbanding a great game. A pox on both 
        their houses. I hope that no city or state will ever again donate a nickel 
        to MLB.</p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">Taxpayer ripoff #2: Foreign aid</font></h2>
      <p>Don't get me wrong. I like foreign aid. What I don't like is saying that 
        we're having foreign aid when we're really taking money from the poor 
        and giving it to the rich.</p>
      <p>For example, we give military aid to Egypt. That aid is used to buy American 
        fighter planes, tanks, and missiles. </p>
      <p>For example, we give humanitarian aid to countries by giving them money 
        but stipulating that they have to buy American grain, or other finished 
        goods with it.</p>
      <p>Think about that for a second. The givernment collects taxes from the 
        public, gives the money to, say, Egypt, and then Egypt turns around and 
        gives it to Boeing or Lockheed. We could cut out the middle man but just 
        giving the subsidies straight to Lockheed, and sending the Egyptians brooms. 
        They have a lot of sand to sweep up. We could send them dustpans and trash 
        bags, too.</p>
      <p>Okay, maybe I'm being unfair. Maybe the Egyptians would want American 
        planes. Maybe they feel safer knowing that their air force is buying the 
        F16, just like the ones that we are selling to the Israelis. Part of the 
        Camp David deal was that we give Israel $3 billion a year, and Egypt $2 
        billion a year. And have been for over 20 years.</p>
      <p>Good fences make good neighbors. But good defenses, geez, a good line 
        of tanks and fighter jets, does that make good neighbors?</p>
      <p>What if we not only cut out the middle man in the middle east? What if 
        we not only didn't launder the money thru foriegn aid before we gave it 
        to Lockheed? What if we just kept it? What if the people of this country 
        just paid $5 billion less in taxes, and Lockheed and GM and Chrysler and 
        the rest of the defense contractors got $5 billion less in foreign sales, 
        and the Israelis and the Egyptians had to kill each other with last 
      year's tanks? They should have plenty of missiles saved up by now.</p>
      <p>Are we really doing the best thing we can think of? </p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">RAM Prices, Redux</font></h2>
      <p>Not long ago, I was amazed at how low RAM prices had gotten. I was nuts. 
        RAM prices weren't low. They're low now, though. At crucial.com, I can 
        find RAM for my Toshiba. 128 MB for $21. For laptop ram.</p>
      <p>I can get 512MB DIMMS for $80. You can get a 1 GB DIMMS for under $200.</p>
      <p>And crucial.com will ship it Fedex 2nd day for no charge.</p>
      <p>Whoever thought that 128MB of RAM would be a stocking stuffer?</p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">The Big Three</font></h2>
      <p>I read last week that the three largest components of international trade 
        are oil, arms, and drugs. Wow.</p>
      <p>Not food. Not cars. I guess that people like their own food and cars. 
        But people will buy and sell power, power, and escape from power.</p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">I Hear Jazz</font></h2>
      <p>I hear it in the way that people talk on the phone. Are they playing 
        it safe or trying a risky improvisation? Now I'm starting to hear it in 
        my PDA and my laptop. It's the electron dance. Of course, there's about 
        30 times as much memory in my Palm Vx as there was in the IBM 360, but 
        it's still amazing that so much information goes in there and takes the 
        shape of words and ideas, but they're really just electrical charges, 
        rushing and swirling and shining around.</p>
      <p>I was working on a client project recently that required some data conversion 
        from the old system's files to the new system's files. We zipped up the 
        files at the client, emailed them to me, I converted the data on the laptop, 
        and emailed the converted data back. In the end, they still had a lot 
        of 1's and 0's on their network, but the 1's and 0's had moved. The music 
        changed and the dancers were doing something different. </p>
      <p>Life, and information, and computation, are just completely amazing. 
        Move your 1's and 0's. Change keys suddenly. </p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">The Lean Organization</font></h2>
      <p>Isn't this just another word for running on empty? For no reserves. For 
        constant hunger? </p>
      <p>When I hear &quot;Lean Organization&quot; I think that if one guy goes 
        on vacation that there's a drop in service level.</p>
      <p>If one kid has a school event and a parent leaves for a day to see it, 
        service level drops.</p>
      <p>If one person gets sick, no one knows how to do their work, and there's 
        a drop in service level.</p>
      <p>Whatever happened to having reserves, planning for the inevitable, and 
        having strength? Why are we flirting with that twitchy line between a 
        marathoner's physique and a POW's?</p>
      <p>I don't think that everyone would refuse to buy a product from a company 
        that takes better care of itself.</p>
