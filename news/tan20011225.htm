      <h1>The Tuesday Afternoon News:<br>
      <font size="4">The Mid-Winter Holiday Arrived at Last</font></h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> 25 December 2001</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Today, on the holiest of Christian days, I want to 
        wish for peace on earth and good will toward men.</p>
      <h2> 
        
         Countries that Start with &quot;I&quot;</h2>
      <p><font size="5"><b><i>W</i></b></font>hat is it with international tensions 
        and countries that start with the letter &quot;I?&quot; I read the paper 
        and it sounds like we're looking at tensions between India and Pakistan, 
        between Israel and Palestine. Not long ago, it was Ireland and England. 
        Iran and Iraq have been warring with their neighbors and each other during 
        the past 20 years.</p>
      <p>Does the I stoke the ego to the point of insanity? Who, in a rational 
        mind, willingly chooses violence to improve his political and economic 
        circumstance? When it's so easy to vote with your feet, why don't more 
        people seek a peaceful resolution to their problems? Heck, you don't even 
        need to follow the immigration laws to live and work in this country, 
        come over here! If yu're stopped for a traffic offense, as I often am, 
        they won't even arrest you here!</p>
      <p>We should keep an eye on Iceland, Indonesia and Italy.</p>
      <p>Or is it the combination of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;P&quot; that is somehow 
        more lethal to peace? Panama, Paraguay, Peru, the Phillipines, Poland, 
        and Portugal are all potential blood enemies of the I-Lands. We should 
        separate the P's and I's the best we can, I suspect. Based on my cursory 
        examination of the world map, I think that the Phillipines and Indonesia 
        are too close. Portugal is not as likely to have troubles with Iceland 
        or Italy - there's really a lot of stuff between them. I worried about 
        Poland and Italy for a while, but I reasoned that they are separated by 
        otherwise level headed peoples and not so likely to engage each other 
        directly. </p>
      <h2>I've Discovered Hide Itoh</h2>
      <p>Okay, I get upset when people say that Columbus discovered America.
      Discovering a place where millions of people live is hardly discovery, in
      the truest sense of the word. And in the same way, I can't say that I've
      discovered Hide Itoh this week, but that's what I want to say. if you go
      to <a href="http://www.pixture.com">www.pixture.com</a>, you can discover
      this artist. His medium of choice is the 32x32 pixel icon. I'm slack-jawed
      at the results. </p>
      <p>Every once in a while, I see someone do something so well that I am
      humbled, and want to slink back home and hide. Hide Itoh lives on another
      plane from me, and I'd like to feel what it's like to be Hide for a day,
      someday. </p>
      <p>In the meantime, please enjoy the opportunity to view his work, and to
      find a cool AIM icon or two. </p>
      <h2>Here Comes Pocket Video&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>Let's put together a few things: DIVX, the IBM Microdrive, and the
      current PDA Displays. Add a pair of headphones and a pair of gloves and
      you've got the makings of Movies On the Go. </p>
      <p>First, let's take the hardware. Current PDAs have screens with 16-bit
      color (that's 65,000 colors, like the old VGA standard) and 240x320 pixel
      displays. SONY has one with a 320x320 display. These displays are
      Reflective Thin Film Transistor (RTFT) displays, which means that you can
      see them great outdoors and indoors. These machines also feature
      CompactFlash Type II slots, which can hold a 5mm thick &quot;card,&quot;
      such as the IBM Microdrive. </p>
      <table border="0" width="99%">
        <tr>
          <td width="62%">The IBM Microdrive is just what it sounds like, a hard
            drive. It comes in three sizes, 340MB, 512MB, and 1GB. This danger
            puppy takes a CFII slot, and then it starts converting your battery
            to heat. Remember the gloves I said you needed? They're for holding
            your PDA while you run this drive.&nbsp;</td>
          <td width="44%"><img border="0" src="images/uscoinmicrodrive.jpg" width="376" height="349"></td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>DIVx is also called MPEG-4. It's a video compression technology. You
      can read about it (and download software for using it) at <a href="http://www.divx.com">www.divx.com</a>.
      It's a cool site besides. With DIVx, you can reduce a DVD small enough to
      fit on a CD. I don't want to trivialize this task - it takes a lot of
      processing power to convert 8GB of data to 700MB of data. But, it actually
      happens. There is already content on the DIVx site that a person can
      download. Full screen, full motion video. </p>
      <p>As I watch these trends - miniaturization of the hardware and greater
      compression of the data, I feel like this is just the first step in a
      progression toward an amazing difference in the way that people
      communicate about the world. I'm reminded of the True Witnesses in Robert
      Heinlein's <i>Stranger in a Strange Land</i>. There might be a day in the
      not-too-distant future when you might carry chips in your pocket, similar
      to today's coins, with events from your life, or entertainments, and be
      able to use and share them as easily as we tell stories now. </p>
      <p>I'm beginning have a vision of an office where seeing the vacation
      slides has crossed over into an entirely different territory. Maybe some
      technologies should only be allowed in the hands of people who can use
      them without boring people. </p>
