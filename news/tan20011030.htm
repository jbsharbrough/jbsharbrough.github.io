        Let's Make a Memorial</font>

      <font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"> 
      <p class="MsoNormal">30 October 2001</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Today I want to discuss creating a memorial to the 
        victims of the 911 attacks on New York, Virginia, and Pennsylvania.</p>
      <h2> 
        
        LET'S MAKE A MEMORIAL 
        
        </h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">We should build a memorial to those to lost their lives 
        in the 911 attacks. I have an idea.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I want to use our most powerful nuclear weapons to 
        make a five mile wide smooth flat line running from east to west across 
        Afghanistan. Let's put it where no one lives, right in the middle of nowhere. 
        Warn anyone who is in the way that it will happen.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Then I want to make another swath five miles wide running 
        from north to south, right through the same mountains. A cross, visible 
        from space. A permanent memorial to those who lost their lives in those 
        terrorist attacks.</p>
      </font></font>
      <p>If they piss us off too much, we'll put an interstate down the middle 
        and line both sides with McDonald's, Home Depot, CostCo, Chili's, and 
        any other piece of pop American culture that they want to try out over 
        there.</p>
      <p>And guys, could you double check your maps and try to miss the Red Cross 
        warehouses? </p>
