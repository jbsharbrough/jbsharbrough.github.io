      How Far to Go to Fight Terror?

      <font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
      <p class="MsoNormal">2 October 2001</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">President Bush says that America is at War with
      Terror. I'm not sure that I know what it means.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I'm in favor of justice. I'm big on safety. My
      friends will tell you that I often say, &quot;Safety first.&quot; And I'm
      in favor of good v evil. I don't even like bad fruits and vegetables. I
      feel like I understand what justice and security and good and evil mean. I
      don't feel like I understand what the war will be about.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It's become increasingly clear that the Al Queda and
      the Taliban in Afghanistan have come to believe that the way for them to
      get what they want in this life is to kill Americans. Osama bin Laden has
      said that followers of Islam have a religious obligation to kill every
      American male, whether they are in the military service or just pay taxes.
      That certainly includes me. Okay, so I'm in a position to kill or be
      killed with those guys, and it's an easy choice. Given the opportunity,
      I'd like to give them all sex change operations and then leave them on the
      streets of Kabul in blonde wigs and bikini bathing suits.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It's also clear that US Secretary of State Colin
      Powell warned the Taliban in May that, in the face of rumors of acts of
      terror planned in the US by Al Queda, that they would be held responsible
      for the actions of groups that they harbor. Their failure to prevent plans
      that were years in the making from taking thousands of American lives puts
      the same blood on their hands.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">These guys are demanding evidence of bin Laden's
      guilt so that they'll think about turning him over to us. We showed them
      plenty of evidence after the 1998 embassy bombings, and they claimed that
      we didn't have any evidence.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Mullah Omar, the Jethro Bodine of the Taliban, is the
      son in law of Osama bin Laden. This guy is a real hillbilly. We should
      send the Arkansas National Guard after these guys - they know the drill.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It's also easy to get mad at AQ and the Talibs
      because they sell drugs.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I don't understand how any people who like eating and
      breathing would want to start a fight with the US.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It's clear that American military, intelligence,
      diplomatic, legal, and financial pressure will be brought to bear on the
      Afghan government and the terrorists that it is trying to protect. It's
      also clear that many of the people involved in that terror also want to
      destabilize the governments of &quot;the Stans&quot; - Tajikistan,
      Uzbekistan, and the like. I don't know what kinds of governments those
      countries have, but I'm seeing a pattern that looks a lot like the spread
      of fascism in Europe and Communism in Asia. I don't' think we can just
      declare democracies for other countries, but it's clear that their
      security and lives are threatened by violence, and I've got an opinion
      about that. So I can imagine us sending people to stop those people,
      capture them if possible, and to take away their ability to do business
      like they do.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I'm just not sure where it goes after that. For
      example, does it go to Iran? In early 2001, the US State Department
      identified Iran as the number one supporter of state sponsored terror in
      2000. Opinions vary on this topic. For example, the US and the Israelis
      consider Hezbollah to be a terrorist organization, but very few other
      countries see it that way. There's a slippery slope of relativism
      stretching before us and our Unending Justice. Is a terrorist in the eye
      of the beholder?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Iraq is a country that has thumbed its nose at the US
      for too long. Many Americans would write a check for someone to go over
      there and kill some people. But will the US and its coalition partners
      conquer Iraq? There is an indication that they've been involved with the
      same people who committed the 911 crimes. I'm sure that there are some
      questions we want answered. But what bothers me more today is, where does
      the war on terrorism stop? Afghanistan, Iran, then Iraq?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">How about North Korea? How about Palestine, or
      Israel? Or both? How about Columbia? How about Chechnya? Basques? Lots of
      Americans would love to make up some evidence about Cuban terrorists and
      use that as an excuse to pick on those people. Will B2 bombers soon fly
      over The Old Sod and blast Ireland? I asked a friend this question,
      &quot;Will we attack Ireland?&quot; and she said, &quot;They aren't
      directly involved in acts of terror here in the US.&quot; That was closer
      to a guideline defining the scope of this effort than anything I've heard
      on TV.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Rephrased, my friend suggested that we go after
      groups that are guilty of crimes in the US. That's at least a much clearer
      guideline than going after groups that commit acts of terror anywhere on
      earth. I'm not sure that it's going to work, though.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Didn't our NATO allies just invoke article 5 of the
      treaty? Isn't an attack on one an attack on all? What are we to do the
      next time that an IRA bomb goes off in the London tube? Look the other
      way?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I'm tired of being from the country that says one
      thing and does another. I'm ashamed of the way that we left un-shredded
      files in the US Embassy in Saigon, which led to the execution of thousands
      of South Vietnamese people who helped our country. I want to see my
      country do something that doesn't embarrass me even more. If she can't
      make me proud, please, at least make sense.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Sooner than later, I'd like to see a clear statement
      of what the US hopes to accomplish by this war on terror. The statements
      that I've heard so far seem sufficient to exact our revenge on Al Queda
      but not much good past that. They seem to open a whole new can of worms.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I wonder how we can really change things in this
      world. I'm not sure that shooting and bombing is our best bet. When
      somebody needs killing, okay. But, after those guys are gone, is there a
      way to make the world safe for our children that doesn't involve beating
      up the people that we don't agree with? I hear that the possibility of war
      between France and Germany is gone because their economies are too intertwined.
      Can we introduce the virus of free trade and functional markets into
      unstable countries, and miraculously make them stable? Why does that sound
      like missionary zeal or a movie plot instead of sensible foreign policy?</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Can we work to remove the seeds of terror? Violence,
      they say, is the last desperate refuge of the powerless. Can we somehow
      reach the people who are led by our enemies, and help them find better
      solutions to the problems in their lives? Some of those problems are old
      ones, they're fights over land that go back a thousand years. I don't
      think we can solve that by being right - which is the strategy of choice
      for Americans. I don't think that, if we knew some Solomonic way to divide
      the land, that we could dictate it to both sides and bring peace. In the
      final analysis, if different peoples want the same thing, such as land,
      and they want it without those other guys around, it will be very hard for
      the US and its coalition partners to fix the problem with guns and bombs.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I'm glad I don't have to solve this problem this
      morning.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Welcome to the ride of your life.</p>
