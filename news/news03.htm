<h1><!--mstheme--><font color="#0000FF">Bonfire 1999<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>There's been a lot of talk this week, following the tragic accident at the
bonfire, of ending that tradition.&nbsp; I've endured enough talk radio opinions
by people who don't understand our traditions that I feel like I have to speak
my piece.&nbsp; I personally hope that we continue with the bonfire.&nbsp; I
think that it will mean more to Aggies than it ever did before -- just like all
of the other traditions that we have that deal with the death of loved ones.</p>
<p>At A&amp;M, I learned that it's not how you die, it's how you live.&nbsp; I
don't think that you can go through your life trying not to die.&nbsp; Two bad
things will happen.&nbsp; One, you'll die anyway.&nbsp; Two, you won't
live.&nbsp; At A&amp;M, we have a treasured tradition of service to a larger
group -- the student body, our families, our country.&nbsp; One other thing that
they taught me at A&amp;M during the 70s was the phrase, &quot;Highway 6 runs
both ways.&quot;&nbsp; They meant that if you don't like it here you can leave
the same way you got here.&nbsp; We didn't leave.&nbsp; We stayed because we
wanted to be part of what we found there.</p>
<p>I don't think that anyone feels like it's a good thing for a young person to
die working on bonfire.&nbsp; Still, Aggies take risks to serve others.&nbsp;
I'm not the only former student who wouldn't say, &quot;Take me, and leave these
kids.&quot;&nbsp; When I was at A&amp;M in the 70s, my job on bonfire was
serving coffee, popcorn and hot chocolate to the people working with the
logs.&nbsp; Bonfire is a bonding experience like no other.</p>
<p>I hope that the leaders at A&amp;M redefine the 12th man tradition to include
work on the bonfire, and honoring all of our other great traditions.&nbsp; And I
hope that the bonfire is preserved so that others can live the same way that so
many have lived before them.&nbsp; I plan to be there next year.</p>
<p>My heart goes out to the friends and families of the Aggies who were hurt
last week.&nbsp; My heart also goes out to the people who don't understand our
tradition of service and sacrifice.&nbsp; The latter group has lost more than
the former, but they have a chance to change that.&nbsp; They could find out
about our traditions:&nbsp; Bonfire, Muster, Silver Taps, the MSC, the drill
field, the Elephant walk, Senior wood, Howdy, the 12th man, the Corps of Cadets,
and many more.&nbsp; Then look at your life and make some traditions of your
own.&nbsp; I hope that you can find as much fraternity and meaning in yours as
we have in ours.</p>
<p>And if you don't care about our traditions, I would only respond, as politely
as I can, that Highway 6 runs both ways.&nbsp; It's bad enough to grieve over
the loss of your own, but it's unimaginable that people would tell us how we
ought to live during our mourning.</p>
<p>--- 21 November 1999</p>
