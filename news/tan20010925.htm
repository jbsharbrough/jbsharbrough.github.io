         <a name="bloodmoney">Blood Money</a> 
        
      </h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I heard that the terrorists on one plane bought one-way 
        tickets for first class, totaling $14,000. My first thought was, “What 
        did the airline do with the money?” Airlines, hotels, flight schools, 
        and car rental agencies are holding money that has the blood of innocent 
        people on it, paid to them by terrorists who appeared innocent and respectable, 
        right before they went to their jobs guiding missiles and butchering flight 
        attendants. I’ll come back to the airlines in a moment for special attention, 
        but first I want to say that it’s not likely that landlords, flight schools, 
        hotels and car rental companies knew what they were doing. I understand 
        that and accept it. Still, I challenge them to wash their hands of it. 
        What can you do with that stuff? If I lost a spouse in the WTC, and you 
        offered me the money, I couldn’t take it. I wouldn’t want to touch it. 
        I’m not sure that it’s possible to create good with blood money.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38092-2001Sep15.html" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38092-2001Sep15.html</a> 
      (link now broken) shows how the airlines have resisted past efforts to improve security. 
        The objection is usually cost. This is such a bad excuse. The cost of 
        good security per ticket is a few pennies. Passengers would pay for it 
        if they knew they were getting value. Instead of selling security to travelers, 
        airlines sold out to cold-blooded murderers. They should make a symbolic 
        act to purify themselves.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I searched the web for a method of disposal of blood 
        money. I found nothing. This must be harder than it looks.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">A portion of the blame for lax security must go to 
        the travelers. We can tell jokes about how the low bidder builds the space 
        shuttle, but the point is that you get what you pay for. We have been 
        very low bidders, as plane travelers. Customers should ask for what they 
        want. Suppliers will often sell it to them.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">While we’re blaming people … I’m one American who is 
        embarrassed by the foreign policy of my country some times. It’s clear 
        that we trained, armed, and supported the <i>mujahadeen</i> in the 80’s 
        as a cold war operation. When the Soviets left, we left and we took our 
        money with us. Okay, I know that we’re not the world’s police, but nation 
        building is good for everybody. The past ten years have been hell on earth 
        for the people of Afghanistan. It’s as if we left them all at WalMart 
        with tanks and RPGs. We could have sent them a billion dollars a year 
        for less than we will spend to bail out the airlines. It’s our pit bull 
        and we should have kept it on a leash.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I’m equally embarrassed about the way we treated the 
        Kurds in Iraq. Most of what I know I saw played out in the movie <i>Three 
        Kings</i>. We told people that we’d protect them if they rose up against 
        their dictators, and then we let them die when Saddam dropped the hammer 
        on them. I feel like I see a pattern of American foreign policy where 
        we try to limit our involvement, where we almost commit to something, 
        where we almost stand for something, where we don’t follow through or 
        finish the job. I don’t like that when it’s someone painting my house, 
        and I don’t like that when people die because they trusted the American 
        government to keep its word. How hard would it be for us to be honest 
        with the rest of the world? I would like that.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Is it too late for me to say that I'm reluctant to
      give the airlines the $15 billion yet? They've sent 100,000 Americans home
      already.&nbsp;<o:p>  Those cuts are probably worth a reduction in costs of
      $5 billion per year after the severance is paid off. I haven't seen any
      indications that the airlines plan to postpone the layoffs due to the
      government aid. Don't the people who AREN'T working need the money more
      than the businesses who aren't paying them any more? I mean, <b>what's
      that money FOR</b>? The airlines aren't going to pay for security in the
      future - the feds will pay for that - air travelers will pay an extra
      dollar a ticket or some such.&nbsp; </p>

      <h2> 
        
         <a name="whatif">What If?</a> 
        
      </h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">It appears to me that the plan for the 911 Attack went 
        something like this:</p>
      
      
      
      <ul style="margin-top:0in" type="disc">
        <li>Hit
    one trade tower. Draw a crowd and some rescue workers.</li>
        <li>Hit
    a second tower. Let everyone see your power and kill some rescue workers.</li>
        <li>Hit
    the pentagon. Draw a crowd, and distract the military.</li>
        <li>Hit
    the capital building. Exclamation point. Game, set, match.</li>
      </ul>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the more cruel tactics in terror is to use the 1-2
punch. The first event draws the police and fire to the scene; the second kills
or maims them. It leads to a very gut-wrenching moment of decision for deploying
relief. The police and fire commanders have to wonder if they should let
innocent people suffer, or risk life and limb by giving them immediate
attention. I’m certain that the next time that they go into harm’s way,
their lives, and those of the helpless victims, will be changed by this
realization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was, simply, a plan to damage and hopefully destroy at
least those four buildings, within 90 minutes of each other. It looks like the
old one-two in NY and then in Washington. I’m just wondering about it all
here, I don’t have any information that hasn’t been on TV or the web. The
last plane was in the air for two hours, burning a lot of its fuel. I wonder if
the terrorists were late getting control, or if they felt like they could do the
job with less explosive power than the other flights.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I wonder if they thought that anyone would still be
inside that late.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Beyond the giant smoking piles of gravel, beyond the
new awareness of danger to police and fire, the biggest point of the attack was
to scare Americans. Hide-under-the-bed, get-in-the-back-of-the-closet,
never-leave-the-house scared. “What have we been spending all the
anti-terrorism money on” scared. “Who can protect us” scared. “What’s
going to be next?” scared. I don’t see how people can avoid questioning
things. It’s a new world and we have to re-think everything. We took a blow to
the body, and we don’t know exactly what to fight for and how. We need some
time to wonder about it. The first punch was a piano falling from the sky, and
we need to get our heads clear.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To the completely wild imagination I’ve already got,
I’ve added this mystery. Why don’t we hear a transcript of the UA93 cockpit
voice recorder? Why don’t government officials flatly deny the involvement of
American fighter planes? I’m wondering because of 1) when it happened, because
the alarm was out; 2) the size of the little pieces; 3) the report of an
explosion before the crash; and 4) the story that the president issued a shoot
down order – was that hypothetical or was there a fighter pilot with a tone
lock? I’m horrified at the prospect of a series of events that includes George
Bush ordering the plane shot down and then recognizing Lisa Beamer in the joint
session of congress. I want to dismiss this thought but it won’t go away until
I see some evidence that dispels it. I’m even considering the possibility that
fighters appeared on the scene, leading to the ditching of the plane. Of course
the wrestling, scuffling story might have produced the same outcome, but I’m
not used to seeing such small pieces. I said it was a cluttered mind and I meant
it.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;American culture is celebrated, and encapsulated, in
our art. Our most vibrant art form is storytelling, most clearly in movies and
their little brother, television. We are trapped in our cultural myths. Almost
every movie has a variation on The Hero Story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The question I’m asking today is, can we think outside our myth? Can we
possibly stretch it enough to discover a realistic path to the future? Do
cultures die when their myths stop sustaining them?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are several variations of The Hero Story, but I’ll
borrow from Syd Field and say that it has a beginning, a middle, and an end
(three acts). There’s a point where the beginning becomes the middle, and a
point where the middle becomes the end. The hero has a character flaw, like all
of us. At the beginning, he is in an environment where the flaw doesn’t hurt
him or his friends. At the end of the first act, something bad happens and the
hero’s flaw controls his reaction. That’s usually a form of going from the
frying pan into the fire. Then he suffers throughout the middle act, when he is
constantly in danger of losing the jihad, the war within, between himself and
his flaw. At the end of the second act, he confronts his opponent and either
wins or loses. I loved George B Cohan’s summary: “a movie has three parts:
first you put your main character up a tree, then you throw rocks at him, then
you get him out of the tree. If the main character is still alive, it's a
comedy; if dead, it's a tragedy.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We have seen the overture. We are entering the First Act
and frankly, I think that we are missing the point. I think that Americans, in
their defiance and loss, are not asking themselves the right questions about why
others might hate us. Instead of returning to the good old bi-polar world where
the Soviets are replaced by Islamic Extremist Terror Cells, could we not ask
ourselves if we could do something to get along better? I’m in favor of
security, of walking softly and carrying a big stick. I just don’t think we
ever walked softly in some parts of the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Look, you can’t please all of the people all of the time, but
couldn’t we go really far trying to understand the ones that we don’t
please? The alternative is to dehumanize them – to turn them into cardboard
cutouts of people. We have always found it easy to treat uncivilized hordes
badly, starting with the original inhabitants of this great land. Could we
recognize that mistake, and at least stop making it over and over? Let’s put a
face, a human face, on our enemy. Let’s understand him as if he were a
complete human being. If Osama bin Laden is not rational, surely at least one of
his followers must be. How could a rational person come to hate America? If we
blow this question off, there will always be an Us against Them on this planet.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s really hard to even make a movie that doesn’t
follow the formula, because people might not get the story. We superimpose this
structure on everything that happens to everyone, in movies and in real life.
It’s how we understand the world. What I wonder today is, “Does it help us
understand, or does it keep us ignorant?” I feel like we’re standing by the
smoking ruins saying, “Who’s the hero? What’s the back-story? Who’s
going to believe this?”&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I laughed out loud. It was a TV commercial for the yellow
pages. A smart-mouthed kid was playing with a computer and ignoring his father,
who stood in the door to his room and asked him to do his chores. “Your
Grandma Nana is on the phone.” “She’s YOUR mother.” That kind of thing.
Then, out of nowhere, a phone book flies into the picture and whacks the kid in
the head. He grunts in surprise, and he and his chair fall backward to the floor. The book lands
opened to Military Schools. I laughed every time the book flew into his head.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It wasn’t funny. A child was hit in the head with a
thrown book.
How unfunny can you get? I wondered why I laughed. I realized that I wanted the
brat to be punished for his impudence, to get a swift and unambiguous message
about what would happen to him if he stepped off the narrow path of
righteousness. I wanted it because it was good for him, and me, and everyone –
staying on the path. I wanted it because actions like his disrespect called for
a slap on the head when I was a kid.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I realize that I feel the same way about the peoples around
the world who smart off to our military power. I get that same narrow knee jerk
reaction where I want to see them whacked with a phone book. I want to see them
get up and apologize and resolve to be better people afterward. Clearly, I’ve
seen too much TV for my own good. I want respect for my superpower status, and I
don’t want to have to ask for it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When I was a child, my parents took great comfort in
corporal punishment. As an adult, with small children, I tried it but soon
realized that I would have to look deeper for a way to lead my family. I couldn’t just
beat them up when I didn’t like what they did. By this point my dad had
formulated a corollary to the Golden Rule, maybe it's the Tin Rule, saying,
&quot;You shouldn't do anything to someone else that they can't do back to
you.&quot; I remember a time when Bailey
wouldn’t stop crying. She was 1 year old, and couldn’t tell me what was
wrong. I tried giving her the bottle, I tried holding her. She was bawling loudly and
people from 50 countries were looking. I could hear their thoughts – “Look,
a white trash Texan who can’t keep his children from crying in public.” She
was broadcasting my inadequacy to the whole world. We were at the observation
deck of the World Trade Towers. I wanted to throw her off. Parenting isn’t
easy, because the parents are a lot stronger than the children and it’s so
tempting to use strength to maintain order. I’ve had a dickens of a time
learning to restrain myself in this life, but I’m happy to say that I’m sure
that there are ways for people to get through this life without having to beat
each other up. I'm pleased to say that in the years since, she struck me
breathless with joy many times.</p>
