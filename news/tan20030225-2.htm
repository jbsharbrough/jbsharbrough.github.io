<h1><!--mstheme--><font face="georgia, Times New Roman, Times">I'm sick of Iraq<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
<p>25 Feb 2003</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
A short timeline might help me explain what I 
  am upset over:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="../_themes/cascade/acasbul1.gif" width="4" height="9" hspace="19" alt="bullet"></td><td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="century gothic, Arial, Helvetica">Aug 1990 - Iraq occupied Kuwait. The UN put a

  only four days. Saddam agreed to an armistice, that provided for the no-fly 
  zones, and the destruction of his WOMD. <!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--></td></tr>
<!--msthemelist--></table><!--mstheme--><font face="century gothic, Arial, Helvetica">
<p>At the time, it was expected that it would take him about 15 hours to do 
this. The decision by the coalition at that time was to leave the pre-war 
sanctions in place until he did so. </p>
<p>He still hasn't done so. </p>
<p>
  Instead of turning them over to coalition 
  forces, he eventually claimed that they had all been destroyed. That didn't 
  get sanctions lifted because no one believed him. The inspectors were NEVER 
  detectives - they were always supposed to play the role of certifying the 
  destruction of WMD. But that isn't what happened. Instead, saddam played cat 
  and mouse games - refusing access to sites, harassing the inspectors, and 
  turning over nothing. At the same time, he and other arabs began to claim that 
  americans were starving children in Iraq.</span></p>
<p>
  This isn't a bad homework complaint. It's not 
  actually about the quality of his records. Even if no records were made, as 
  was often the case in Bosnia and Kosovo, someone who was involved in the 
  destruction of the weapons could take inspectors to the site where the 
  destruction happened, and they could attempt to forensically verify the 
  government's claims. </span>
</p>
<p>
  What the Iraqi government HAS done, is to promise for 12 
  years that they would disarm, and prove it, without actually doing so. You can 
  only say that &quot;the check is in the mail&quot; for so long before people just decide 
  that you're a deadbeat and treat you accordingly. Saddam has said that the 
  check is in the mail for too long for anyone to believe what he says anymore.</span></p>
<p>
  In the meantime, saddam has been sharpening 
  his abilities to divide his enemies. I think he is very good at it. He does it 
  two ways. One is by making illegal deals to break the sanctions. Simply&nbsp;put, 
  the sanctions don't work, they've never worked, and they're not keeping iraqi 
  oil in or foreign products out. The other is by saying that he's cooperating 
  when he doesn't actually do so. That's been demonstrated most clearly since 
  the new inspectors have been in. Blix, in both&nbsp;reports&nbsp;to the UN, has stated 
  clearly that they are not getting sufficient cooperation from Saddam.</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  To the above, I would add that there is a lot 
  of disagreement about what resolution 1441 means. It was clear to the US that 
  it was a &quot;last chance to come clean&quot; resolution.&nbsp;That's not what happened - 
  saddam produced 12,000 pages of ten year old&nbsp;documents that don't answer any 
  of the 30 questions that Blix has for him. And now that Saddam hasn't come 
  clean, some western countries are saying that the inspections are containing 
  him, and that they should be continued.</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  Sanctions didn't work. Inspections didn't 
  work.&nbsp;I believe that the only reason that we have inspections today is because 
  the president of the US made it clear that he intends to use force to disarm 
  this man.&nbsp;I think it's all that saddam understands, and that he will disgust 
  the world as he goes down.</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, the US has completely lost 
  the PR war. </span>
</p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  They haven't successfully connected or 
  separated the issues of Iraqi disarmament from the war on terror. This 
  confusion leads people to think that the government is just connecting them 
  with lies. We should have managed the message better - and stuck to 
  disarmament and regional peace as our goal.</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  We've always said the same thing about the 
  Middle east. And it is interesting that we have a great ally in that region, a 
  militarily powerful one, and we have NEVER teamed up with them to fight 
  Saddam. The Israelis are such political dynamite that you can't ever do 
  anything with them or you'll have to fight all the Arabs at once. So instead, 
  we fight Saddam with the English and the Latvians. What is it about the middle 
  east that you can't have your allies go to war with you?</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  It's tough to be the 800 pound gorilla. A lot 
  of people don't want you moving around in their living rooms, but they want 
  you to solve every problem that comes up. Usually it means paying american 
  money to keep someone else happy. The $26 billion in Turkish aid is a whole 
  lot of money. It's more than the amount of money that we give Israel and Egypt 
  combined, in five years. Yikes it's a lot.</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  We are not an all-knowing, all-powerful country who tries to impress 
  the will of its leaders on the world. We're just trying to fit in 
  without&nbsp;giving up to&nbsp;the guy who would rather starve his people for 12 years 
  than give up his toys.</span></p>
<p>
  &nbsp;</p>
<p>
  The rest is just elbow grease.</p>

<p>I don't know what to make of the news anymore.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I read recently that during the Haj, in Mecca, many Muslim leaders stated
publicly that we are infidels and that Muslims who die fighting us will
be martyrs. [1] <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I read recently that people stood by and did nothing while Allan Price lay
dead at a DC area service station. [2]<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I read recently how happy the Iraqis are about the displays of support for
peace (and opposition to war) that people showed around the world
yesterday. [3] My own skeptical view is that it appears to be something
that people don't mind standing up for as long as they don't have to
take any time off from something really important, like working Monday
through Friday. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I read recently that Osammy bin Laden says that the president of the United
States is stupid. [4] He wants to die this year &quot;in the belly of the
eagle.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I wonder where the sense is, in all of it. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
It's been my impression that the US has no interest in world domination.
We already conquered the world, in 1945, along with our allies. Unlike
the Soviets, who occupied eastern Europe for the next 50 years, the US
asked for free trade. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
was the price we extracted for our help around the world. Heck, we paid
to rebuild the factories in Germany and Japan that we had destroyed. By
the time that the 70's came, we were at a competitive disadvantage with
those countries because they had newer and better factories than we did.
That doesn't sound like world domination to me. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I always thought that we are the live and let live types. We don't
insist that the world like us. We like a chance to trade on an even
footing, but that's all. We don't make their governments subsidize our
Macdonald's and Pizza Huts and movies. Those enterprises succeed abroad
because of the one truth that really makes some people angry:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
American stuff is cool.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Fast food is cool. So are movies. So is pop music. And computers.
Something about our culture gives us an amazing hammerlock on the
development of software, SAP aside. We do cool things with basketballs,
stock cars, and the internet. I don't think that we do any of that with
the thought in mind that we will influence people and events around the
globe. Most of us are interested in making it to the weekend and then
getting our balance back.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
We haven't historically taken sides in the fight between the Arabs and
the Israelis [5]. I don't know anyone wants to be in the middle of that.
But we try to be fair with both sides. Is that the same thing as trying
to dominate?<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I feel like we can't stand around and watch either side bleed to death
and do nothing, like the anonymous customers did with Allan Price. We
have to stand for what we believe is right, and against what we think is
wrong. We don't have to send the army over to a country to make our<br>
statement. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
But when they came here and kill innocent people, we promised to never
forget. We're under attack by a cult of camping Islamic hillbillies who
have a lot of money and think it's cool to kill Americans.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I don't agree with Condoleeza Rice much. She's really smart but she went
to Stanford and she talks down to people too much. I agree with her
today - our patience has been tried and is near an end. UN Resolution
1441 was not a resolution to reinstitute the inspections of the early
90's. It was a &quot;one last chance&quot; opportunity for Iraq to come clean
about WMD or else. As has been his historical reaction, Saddam used that
chance to mock the process, to call the inspectors spies, and to do
anything but disarm.&nbsp; <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I'd be happy to ignore him, if I could safely conclude that none of his
weapons are going to go off in New York, or Atlanta, or Houston. Like
Pete Rose, he's past the point where any words from him will change my
mind. He has been given one last chance to act, and he's abused it. I
think that last August, the Economist editors made the case for war very
plainly [6].&nbsp; I want to point out that after the Persian Gulf War, we
found lots more WMD in Iraq than we had imagined. The post-war sanctions
that the UN imposed on Iraq 11 years ago were to be lifted as soon as
the weapons inspectors were finished. Saddam has chosen the starvation
of his people over disarmament. He's stuck to that choice for so long
that people around the world are accusing the West of starving Muslims
and wanting their oil.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
It seems that a billion Muslims see the US as their enemy, and that they
think that killing innocent Americans is a blessed act, and that
millions of people around the world don't want the US to implement our
new doctrine of pre-emption of terrorism. And that Americans will finish
tanking up, pay for it, and drive home while the next motorist lies dead
by the pump. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
I'm glad that baseball spring training has started.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
I don't know what to make of the news anymore.<br>

Thomas Friedman of the NYTimes says that 9/11 was the beginning of World War 
III. Today, I saw that the Iranians are saying that american troops in Iraq 
after the war won't be welcome. </p>
<p>Sheesh. We're putting them there so they won't be in Saudi Arabia. How are we 
supposed to protect these kingdoms and their oil if they won't give us bases in 
the region?</p>
<p>I'm sure that Mr Friedman is right. It appears that something that looks 
curiously like the Crusades is happening again. Muslims are threatening 
religious war with the US. </p>
<p>Today, I feel like making a martyr out of anyone who wants to volunteer.<br>
