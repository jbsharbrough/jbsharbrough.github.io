  Civil Liberty and Terror</font><font face="georgia, Times New Roman, Times">

<p>27 Sept 2003</p>
<p>I read recently that the administration of the Federal Government wants more 
  power to pursue suspected terrorists, including the ability to use &quot;administrative 
  subpoenas&quot; which would not require the signature of a judge. Prior to enacting 
  a change like this, the case for its necessity should be brought forth. That 
  has not happened. Examples of police work where a judge was unavailable for 
  a midnight warrant have not been discussed. </p>
<p>My concern, when I see these stories, is that we are well on our way down a 
  slippery slope. If we surrender our freedoms, including that fourth amendment 
  right to avoiding illegal search and seizure, in order to prevent terrorism, 
  then aren't we losing the war already? If the threat of terror makes us lose 
  our rights to live the way we choose, then what more do they have to do to us? 
  Aren't we giving up too much too easily?</p>
<p>The case mentioned in the article I saw was a hypothical case where they get 
  a tip at midnight, the suspect is booked on an international flight the next 
  day, and they need to get some records about the guy in the middle of the night. 
</p>
<p>I don't want to see money men support terror and get away with it. But couldn't 
  we just put three judges on three shifts like they do at the hospital? Are we 
  faced with a situation where the judges refuse to work at night to protect us 
  from the police? In another 20 years we'll all be federal judges and we can 
  surely get three shifts then.</p>
<p>And can't you arrest someone on suspicion, and hold them up to 24 hours? Arrest 
  him, get a subpoena or warrant the next morning, and search whatever you like 
  while your terror suspect cools it in the Boston jail.</p>
<p>Are we now guilty until proven innocent? Or, even more thinly, are we now perhaps 
  guilty and you want to rummage through my life to find out? Wouldn't that produce 
  an army of right-thinking apparatchiks that would see a terrorist behind every 
  tree? And before you say no, I'm going to tell you that it already has.</p>
<p>The mindset that is going into fighting terror is a familiar one. We saw it 
  in Germany in the 1930's, and in other totalitarian police states. And in Huron 
  County, Ohio, they have caught the fever. The state passed a new law raising 
  the fees for copies of birth and death certificates. The local health district 
  interpreted that as the signal for an anti-terror campaign. Not only do they 
  refuse to issue copies of these public records, but they went down to the library 
  and confiscated the microfilm copies of previously published records that were 
  in the possession of the local genealogy society. There are still lots of copies 
  of the records available on microfilm - the copy that they siezed was purchased 
  from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Salt Lake City, Utah.</p>
<p>Well, a man should act on his beliefs, that's a good thing. Someone in Huron 
  County has some misguided beliefs, and &quot;A Little Power.&quot; A little 
  power is an ugly thing. I see it in lines at the airport - &quot;you'll have 
  to put that fanny pack into one of those other two bags or you'll be fined $1000. 
  Please step aside while you do that because I don't want you holding up my line.&quot; 
  I'm kind of reminded about that story that Tommy Lasorda tells, about the banquet 
  circuit incident when he wanted more butter and the guy wouldn't give it to 
  him. &quot;Perhaps you don't know who I am,&quot; Lasorda said. &quot;Perhaps 
  you don't know who I am,&quot; was the reply. Lasorda said, &quot;You're right, 
  I don't know who you are. Who are you?&quot; &quot;I'm the guy in charge of 
  the butter.&quot;</p>
<p>So the Chief Butter Marshall is now running the General Health District in 
  Huron County Ohio, and John Ashcroft wants to be able to make any subpoena he 
  wants without judicial review. </p>
<p>How long until John Ashcroft decides that genealogy research is a forbidden 
  practice because it might support terror? And wouldn't this have been a boring 
  summer in Huron County until the Health District got uppity?</p>
