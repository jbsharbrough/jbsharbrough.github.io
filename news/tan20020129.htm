      <h2> <font color="#0000CC"> 
        
        People are Crazy:<br>
        Budzilla, the Destroyer 
        
        </font><font color="#0000ff"> </font></h2>
      <p>I've complained about Bud Light, the sometimes owner of the Brewers and 
        the sometimes pretend commissioner of baseball, already of late. Since 
        that time, he's gone so far into Bizarro World that I can only shake my 
        head. In particular, I'm astounded to learn that he violated the rule 
        prohibiting owners from making secret deals with each other, by borrowing 
        money from the owner of the Twins, Carl Pohlad. He's still saying that 
        there might be two teams contracted this year - it's so ludicrous. </p>
      <p>A recent article in the Dallas Morning News (the DaMN paper) listed all 
        of the litigation going on in baseball - Bud and the Congress, Bud and 
        the state of Minnesota, Bud and the people of Florida, Bud and the players. 
        There must be a hundred lawyers with kids in private schools that love 
        Bud.</p>
      <p>Right after the Arizona beat the Yankees in a great World Series, the 
        public interest in baseball was high, and the buzz was very positive. 
        Bud picked that week to announce contraction plans. &quot;Let's take away 
        two teams, because two guys don't want to field teams anymore. More beer 
        for the rest of us.&quot; A master stroke of timing, it reminded everyone 
        that these guys are not interested in baseball and they can't even pretend 
        long enough to fool people.</p>
      </font></font>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The price of free agents 
        this year looks a lot like it did the last time that baseball got into 
        trouble for collusion. I'm really suspicious. Maybe I'd be less suspicious 
        if these same people hadn't been found guilty of collusion (and fined 
        $200 million) the only other time that free agent salaries fell in the 
        past 25 years.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">Write this down: the owners 
        of MLB and their lead droog, Budzilla, will destroy the leagues that they 
        play in. I'm not as upset about this as I used to be - I no longer fear 
        that they will destroy the game. They'll only destroy their own companies, 
        and the game will survive without them, and probably prosper. I wish they 
        would hurry up and flush themselves into sports history so I can watch 
        Bonds, Griffey, and Sosa chase the Babe.</font></p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">General News:<br>
        Attleboro and the Pats</font></h2>
      <p>I saw a frightening sight last Sunday At Attleboro High School, in Attleboro 
        MA, there was a swim meet. In one room that they called the &quot;Sports 
        Bar&quot; they were serving pizza, hot dogs and sodas at a concession 
        stand, and watching the pool and the NFL Conference finals on 2 television 
        sets. </p>
      <p>I'm afraid to say how many people crowded into that room, but I'm glad 
        that the fire marshal didn't come by. I hope that he was watching the 
        Pats at the firehouse. Everyone in there was pulling for the Pats, they 
        all knew about the differences in Tom Brady and Drue Bledsoe, and they 
        all booed when Bledsoe came on the field. </p>
      <p>I realized that they all shared a connection here - that the story of 
        the Pats was a story for all of them. It gave me pause.</p>
      <p>Pro sports teams have been conning cities and states into subsidies for 
        years, and I've written many times that I oppose this practice. Teams 
        should build their own stadiums, and then they wouldn't be able to move 
        away from a big asset like that. It's also been a lot easier to divorce 
        myself from the local teams by judiciously monitoring my speech and replaceing 
        the word &quot;we&quot; with &quot;The Rangers&quot; and the word &quot;us&quot; 
        with &quot;them.&quot; I'm not part of the team and they don't know that 
        I exist. </p>
      <p>That cynicism ran off a cliff in Attleboro. Unnamed millions of New Englanders 
        make an emotional investment in the success of the Pats. When they made 
        a good play, the room rocked with cheers. These aren't naive fans. They've 
        been watching the Red Sox play bridesmaid since 1918. They can spot a 
        team that is good enough to make them hope but not good enough to be champions. 
        Yet here they were, cautiously pulling for the Patriots to beat the Steelers 
        in Pittsburgh and earn a trip to New Orleans for the Super Bowl.</p>
      <p>And when they did win, every man in the place seemed to exhale and relax. 
        I must have heard, &quot;I don't mind. The Pats won&quot; a dozen times. 
        People all over five states mellowed out because some company (the New 
        England Patriots) performed well in a trial (the conference championships). 
        Maybe the social benefits of having a team to unite a region are worth 
        some of the extortion that they pay to keep their teams.</p>
      <p>Its probably a good idea to point out that I haven't heard any rumors 
        about the Pats moving - they're just the most obvious recent example of 
        what having a good team can do for an area. In comparison, I wonder what 
        event or announcement could come from the mayor of Boston or the governor 
        of Massachusetts that would create the same reaction. I mean, if they 
        voted to give every family in New England $20, I don't think that it would 
        produce as much good will - and it would certainly cost more.</p>
      <p>Maybe I was wrong, and the teams DO belong to the regions. If that's 
        true, there are a lot of regions that ought to get their sleazy owners 
        out of there so that they can have better teams. Maybe it makes sense 
        for the governor to review the performance of a state's pro teams and 
        protect the public interest. &quot;Pass more.&quot; &quot;Get some better 
        linebackers.&quot; Why stop at the pros? It would make sense for the mayor 
        of Houston to look over the shoulder of Mack Brown at Texas. &quot;Win 
        a bowl game.&quot;</p>
      <p>In case it's not clear yet, I think that sports are bread and circuses. 
        They take our minds off the jobs lost at Enron or the price of electricity 
        and help us deal with a difficult life. What I saw last weekend was how 
        much good it can create when people feel that a team represents them, 
        and they take pride in the performance of their champions. Being a Houston 
        native, I'm not very familiar with this. A New York native who was a close 
        friend was incredulous, &quot;You've never had a World Series?&quot; You'd 
        think that they had one every year in New York. Okay, they have a lot 
        of them. Don't rub it in.</p>
      <p>Before you decide that I became a Pats fan for a day, I want to point 
        out that I picked them to win the AFC before the playoffs began. I guess 
        you don't have to live in New England to enjoy the Pats.</p>
      <h2><font color="#0000FF">Movies:<br>
        Oscar Tour 2002 coming soon</font></h2>
      <font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica"> 
      <p>Each year for a long time, I've loaded up a spreadsheet withthe movies 
        that get the most nominations and raced the clock to see them before the 
        Academy Awards. I rate them from 1 to 4 cows and then see how much I agree 
        with the Academy. Okay, I admit it, I understand that the purpose of the 
        whole Oscar deal is to run a commercial for people to go see movies. I 
        have no problem with that. I love movies. I like shows about movies. I'm 
        not going to tell you what's wrong with the Academy and their choices 
        of winners, because the academy is its own game, and isn't subject to 
        some standard that I might imagine that they should follow. I accept that. 
        I want more of it.</p>
      <p>The last few years, I've tried to anticipate the nominations by starting 
        on a tentative list and seeing the slam dunks early. This year that means 
        seeing <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> and maybe 
        <i>Mulholland Drive</i> and some others. I haven't made much progress 
        but I'm getting into the mood. </p>
      <p>My personal taste in movies keeps me from ever seeing my favorites get 
        involved. They never nominated <i>Independence Day </i>for best picture 
        in 1997, and they won't nominate <i>Spy Kids</i> this year. No problem, 
        I'll just watch more movies.</p>
      <p>Why do I like the movies so much? Well, besides the fact that a lot of 
        people are trying really hard t do something well, I like them because 
        it's a two hour dream about our culture, a vision, a myth retelling using 
        cameras and surround sound. I think I could get through life describing 
        every situation as being like some scene in a movie and probably get rpetty 
        close to describing a re-occurance of some fictitious events with imaginary 
        characters - and then I could make choices in the real world based on 
        the outcomes that those people had! I think some people probably get thru 
        life just fine like that. And isn't that my point? That movies teach us 
        about life?</p>
      </font></font>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">I'm sure that most of the 
        people I know get all of their history from Robert Redford and Mel Brooks. 
        Most people seem to have computer network understandings based on the 
        systems that they use in the movies. That is generally very fake and done 
        because it photographs well - it ain't real.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">We'll talk about movies a 
        lot in the coming weeks, the high season for them is upon us.</font></p>
