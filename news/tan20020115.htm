      <h1>The Tuesday Afternoon News:<br>
      <font size="4">Activation Doesn't Activate Me</font></h1>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> 15 January 2002</p>
      <h2>Microsoft and Activation</h2>
      <p><font SIZE="2">My pet peeve these days is Microsoft's activation. It's
      clearly aimed at stopping &quot;casual piracy&quot; but there are some
      problems with their model.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="2">First, they are extremely profitable at their current
      price point. I'm not saying that the right and wrong of it all is based on
      whether MS has a lot of money or a little - clearly piracy and stealing
      are wrong. The issue I'm trying to raise is the question about whether MS
      has chosen an approach that is appropriate to the problem they have. They
      aren't proposing to cut the prices in half in order to stop piracy.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="2">Second, the process of activation is slow and cumbersome
      and represents a tax on businesses, sort of an honesty tax, which their
      research shows most customers don't deserve. They've chosen to assess this
      tax from every user, but only honest users will ever go through
      activation. Microsoft has one set of statistics for how long it takes,
      claiming 5-7 minutes of phone time. Users report a different experience,
      something on the order of 11-15 minutes. MS counters that 80% of
      activations take place on the web and that they've never had the volume in
      the call centers that they expected.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Third, I think that the decision to completely lock out
      the software on failed activation is a bad decision. If it was coded to
      give a person 1 day or 2 hours before locking up, users could choose when
      to call MS without putting their work at risk.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Fourth, I think that the use of activation signals a
      clear change in basic strategy for Microsoft. Large corporations and
      individuals don't just buy products, they buy into the supplier's business
      strategy. Until now, it was at least possible to pretend that Microsoft
      believed that the key to their long term success was continually making
      tools that people could use to do their work better, cheaper, and faster.
      Now it's clear that their business strategy is to get as much cash from
      users as possible, without regard for the impact on business and
      individuals.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">Microsoft counters that activation is not new, that
      Novell and other companies have used it for years, without the public
      outcry that has met activation. That's a good point, because those are
      products that are sold, by and large, to large businesses with IT support
      staffs. Windows and Office, on the other hand, are --- or at least have
      been -- consumer products, widely sold to individuals and small offices
      without access to the technical staff to deal with activation
      issues.&nbsp;</font></p>
      <p><font SIZE="2">And finally, their model is that since only 40% of
      office is licensed, then if we create a technological barrier to piracy
      we'll get more money. That's just linear thinking. People won't put the
      second copy of Office on the second pc, and they won't use the second pc
      either. They'll modify their resource allocation to meet their own needs
      and expectations. Microsoft acts as if people will spend more for their
      software if they can't steal it - and I think that the software is way
      overpriced already. People won't spend any more then they do now.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">One of the most enlightening examples of protecting
      intellectual property I ever saw was the example of the paperback book.
      Can you imagine a person standing at a copier and xeroxing a 300 page
      paperback? I can't, because the cost of stealing it is higher than the
      cost of buying it. If Microsoft wants to make the cost of stealing
      software higher, they might think about reducing the cost of buying it as
      well.</font></p>
      <p><font size="2">A parting thought, for those of you still using Office
      97 or Office 2000. MS is calling Office XP &quot;old,&quot; saying that
      18-24 months is about the right amount of time for a product before a
      follow-on comes out. Get ready for Office YP, or whatever is next.&nbsp;</font></p>
