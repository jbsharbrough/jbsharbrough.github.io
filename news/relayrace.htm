      <p>Sometime in the spring of 1970, we had a relay race at track practice. 
        Now, we did a lot of things at track practice. I remember having assignments 
        like running 8 220's in 36, 34, or 32 seconds, whatever the coach would 
        tell us. We were expected to have a sense of pace - to know whether we 
        were running half a lap at one speed or the other. I also remember a day 
        when we were running quarters in about 65 or 66, then walking one, then 
        running another. As we'd come across the starting / finish line, Coach 
        Rushing would be standing there with his stopwatch, and we'd say, &quot;You 
        got me?&quot; and we'd do. Once, when I came across the line, Mr LaForge 
        made some clever comment. Now, I don't have a competitive attitude or 
        anything, and I'm sure that I've never done anything to smart off to one 
        of our school administrators, but I do remember being disturbed by his 
        comment. I didn't walk a lap. Instead, I said, &quot;You got me?&quot; 
        and ran another quarter in 64 or whatever. I didn't realize at that time 
        that my efforts to spite The Man were a whole lot of work for me, so I 
        just did the immature thing and ran all the time. But that's not the story 
        I want to tell you.</p>
      <p>I'm pretty sure it was the spring of 1970 because Mike Funderburke was 
        in the class of 1970 and he was out there. Apparently Coach Rushing was 
        not happy with the handoff between Steve Cox and David Funderburke on 
        the spring relay. I can't remember who handed off to who, but I think 
        that Steve ran the back straight and that David ran the curve. Anyhow, 
        this particular day, we were the only four guys out there, along with 
        Coach Rushing. Mike would get a &quot;rolling start&quot; at one goal 
        line on the football field, and I can't remember if Steve got one or not 
        - I think he had to start from dead stop. That rolling start was a lot 
        of an advantage.</p>
      <p>Running on and around the football field was great, in the 10th grade. 
        We had stakes to mark the quarter mile &quot;track&quot; around the football 
        field, but I think that the stakes went away, and were replaced by the 
        bare dirt path that so many boys wore in the grass. We came in 3rd in 
        the state track meet in 1970, and we didn't even have a track at our school. 
        If I was a high school track coach without a track, I'd probably use that 
        as an excuse to lower my goals, and the goals of my boys. Coach Rushing 
        must not be as smart as me, because he didn't let a detail like not having 
        a track keep him from building a track powerhouse at Alief. But that's 
        not the story I want to tell you.</p>
      <p>I waited at midfield, with David. As Mike and Steve came close to us, 
        we took off. Mike and I used the mile relay handoff. This is a protocol 
        where the guy coming in says, &quot;Take!&quot; and that's then the guy 
        leaving turns around to the right, looks back at him, and takes the baton 
        in his right hand, and sets off. It's a very easy handoff to too, and 
        very few mile relays drop the baton. Steve and David, on the other hand, 
        were doing the blind handoff that is used on the sprint relay. The guy 
        who is leaving sets a mark on the ground, just like with the mile relay 
        handoff. But he takes off at full speed, not with the loping stride that 
        the quarter-milers use, and when the man coming in shouts, &quot;Take!&quot; 
        he doesn't turn around. He just holds his right hand out behind him, palm 
        up, hand open, as still as he can while running at top speed. The man 
        coming in lays the baton in his hand, and he closes his fingers around 
        it and takes off.</p>
      <p>Or at least that's the plan. This is a hard handoff to get right, and 
        sprint relay teams drop the baton all the time. Steve and David were being 
        worked extra to try to get their handoffs right. Mike and I were just 
        targets to help them focus.</p>
      <p>Steve and David were both faster than me in the sprints. I think I broke 
        11 seconds in the hundred yard dash a couple of times, but I'm sure that 
        I never ran under 10.8. Except that one time in the summer Olympics (not 
        the real ones, these were somewhere on South Main) when the big guy in 
        the lane next to me ran 9.8 - I came in at 10.5 that one time. Steve and 
        David were always running 10.5 or better. I'm pretty sure that they were 
        both faster than Mike, too. In other words, we were the two slowest guys, 
        using the slow handoff. They were the two fastest guys, using the fast 
        handoff.</p>
      <p>We beat them three times in a row. Mike used that rolling start to great 
        advantage. We were turning in 100 yard dash times under 10 seconds, with 
        a handoff in the middle. I realized that day that having a head start 
        is better than being fast, and better than a smooth handoff. Actually, 
        I think that our handoffs went very smoothly. We were still the slowest 
        runners, but it was a hoot to beat those guys.</p>
      <p>When I was 15, speed was a thing that had its own reward. There weren't 
        many feelings better than tearing down the field as fast as you could 
        go. We were running 100 miles a week back then, and I had about 3 percent 
        body fat. We were in some kind of shape. And when we got going at top 
        speed, running was about the easiest thing in the world. Maybe it was 
        the momentum, or a tailwind, but there was no effort, no conscious thought 
        to it. It's the closest thing to flying I can remember. </p>
      <p>Now, more than 30 years later, it's very different. That kind of physical 
        conditioning, and that kind of speed, are just childhood memories. Being 
        from Alief meant we had lots of special memories. They came from volunteering 
        for lots of school activities - with some people who turned out to be 
        really fine human beings. In hindsight, we treasure days like the day 
        that we had the relay race.</p>
      <p>Mike and I treasure it the most, I bet.<br>

    <td>On 21 May 2003, I received the following information in an e-mail from 
    David Funderburke. He's right about everything. He always was.<font SIZE="2"><p>
    First, I do not remember that particular day. That doesn't really mean 
    anything other than my ever-diminishing brain cells. Although, I would think 
    I would remember you EVER beating me in something less than 880 distance! 
    (just kidding!)</p>
    <p>Second - I always handed off to Steve Cox. The sequence was Billy Davis 
    to me to Cox to my brother Mike. So it is possible that you confused my 
    brother and me - that would make more sense both in handoff sequence, and 
    for you and one other person (me) to consistently beat two of the relay team 
    members! </p>
    <p>Third - handoff method. The leading runner didn't lay his hand back and 
    leave it there until the trailing runner laid it in his hand. Running with 
    one hand extended behind is inefficient. The 'innovation' of the times, 
    which Coach Rushing introduced to us that year, was a blind handoff 
    completely in stride, in a true running motion. The leading runner would get 
    up to speed, then open his baton-carrying palm at the end of the normal 
    running backswing of his arm. The trailing runner would match speed and also 
    match stride so that his baton hand was reaching forward as the leader's 
    baton hand was reaching back. The timing had to be such that as the leader 
    and trailer matched speeds, the two baton hands came together at the same 
    time. Then the trailer simply laid the baton in the leader's hand. The goal 
    was to make the handoff by the third time the leader opened his palm. With 
    literally thousands of practice handoffs, we would hit the handoff almost 
    always on the second offer. This handoff technique was a key reason why we 
    did so well in the sprint relay that year - we may not run as fast, but our 
    handoff was more efficient than the competition.</p>
    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>David</p>
