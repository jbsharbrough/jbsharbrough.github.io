<body><h2><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The Tuesday Afternoon
      News:<br>
Very odd, but no End Zone</font></h2>
      <font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
      <p class="MsoNormal">23 October 2001</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Today I want to discuss several topics: Windows XP,
      Historical Perspective, The Knowledge War, Future Medicine, and the Fighting Texas Aggies.</p>
      <h2>WINDOWS XP</h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I've chosen not to be the first XP guy in my family.
      I've read that in the process of &quot;activation&quot; XP makes up some number that identifies
      up to 10 components in your computer, and
      won't run if you change something that doesn't match that number. MS ,
      according to magazine reports, won't divulge the algorithm. Having used a
      lot of MS software, I'm going to take a skeptical stance that they will
      add a complication like this to the normal operation of the computer, and
      somehow avoid making mistakes.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Mostly, I read this &quot;enhancement&quot; as a
      clear signal that Microsoft places a higher priority on making money than
      they do on enabling user processing. In doing so, they are opening the
      door to a company who reverses those values. There's nothing wrong with
      making money, but MS will soon demonstrate that you can put too much emphasis
      on it.</p>
      <h2>HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</h2>
      <p>We are presently dealing with terrorists and an anthrax scare.
      Historically, we have faced worse, and survived it. There was a cholera
      epidemic that killed half the population of Manhattan in 1832. Every town
      along the Erie Canal saw people running out into the countryside, bringing
      the sickness with them. Anthrax spores travel well, but it's hard to
      catch. So far, it appears to be an attack aimed at famous people, which is
      actually hurting people who carry and open mail. I'm glad that we live in
      an enlightened age when being sick isn't seen as God's punishment for
      being bad. Cholera is a virus, but people at the time thought it was an
      Irish disease, or a poor man's disease, or a Negro disease. Now we know
      that viruses and spores are not respecters of persons - anybody can get
      it.</p>
      <p>Between 1894 and 1901, five heads of state were killed by anarchists.
      The anarchists resembled the loosely grouped Islamic fundamentalists -
      they weren't unified by what they were for, but rather by what they were
      against. Their victims included the 20th president of the US, William
      McKinley, shot in Buffalo NY on 6 September 1901 - a century and five days
      before 911. The man who shot him was an &quot;independent anarchist&quot;
      as opposed to a famous one or a member of an group.</p>
      <p>I don't recall reading that a global coalition was formed to fight
      anarchy - it looks like it ran out of steam on its own. Yet, powerful
      people were concerned about it, and when they lost their lives, one after
      the other, I'm sure that many people wondered what the world was coming
      to. They probably wondered what would happen next, and how these things
      could have been allowed to happen.</p>
      <p>History is full of stories about how the power of states waxes and
      wanes. It's clear that the cost effectiveness of projecting physical power
      correlates with the power of secular governments. It looks from here like
      costs are dropping and governments are strengthening these days.</p>
      <h2><a name="MAKING PEACE">THE KNOWLEDGE WAR</a></h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Yesterday, I saw a news clip of Northern Alliance
      troops on horseback, advancing on Taliban positions. I realized that there
      is no comparison in the power of the Taliban troops and the US military.
      The difference in the strength of their men and ours is not much. The
      difference in the power of their rifles and the rocket propelled grenades
      and ours is
      not much. What's grossly mismatched is the power of American machines, and
      the imbalance of knowledge between the Americans and the Taliban.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In the dark, the Americans can see everyone.
      Everywhere. The Taliban can't see anything but the flashes. The Americans,
      having that advantage, have all of the initiative. The Taliban can only
      react. When these skirmishes are over, the power of a big knowledge gap
      will be clearly visible.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Last week, the US sent 100 Rangers into Kandahar and
      brought them all home. The message, if I understood it, was a show of
      force to the Taliban - &quot;We can go where we want, when we want.&quot;
      Perhaps the risks for US forces were low, but this is harm's way. I
      suspect that the message is intended to reach moderates in the south,
      encouraging them to flip sides without fear of reprisal from the Taliban.
      God is on the side of the big battalions.</p>
      <h2>FUTURE MEDICINE</h2>
      <p>It seems inevitable that people will learn a whole new form of
      preventive medicine. To the extent that we have any medicine these days,
      it's reactive. When you get symptoms, you go to the doctor. She reacts to
      them with a treatment plan. Someday, when we understand the variations in
      the human genome and the tendencies that they beget, we'll understand what
      proteins that your body should be making but isn't, or vice versa. Then
      you'll be able to take a supplement to offset it.</p>
      <p>There is a lot of research into cutaneous medicine delivery today, too.
      It is likely that your protein supplement will be a smart patch. No pills
      to swallow, no vitamins to chew. Just a Personal Supplement Patch.</p>
      <p>There could be some interesting changes in the way we act. Each of us
      would need different things, and would work to earn our daily supplements.
      I can imagine a lot of personalization taking place.</p>
      <p>I guess that &quot;protein therapy&quot; is less threatening to people
      than the idea of &quot;gene therapy&quot; or of cooking up perfect babies
      in test tubes. I suspect that some people will try those things too. Me, I
      just want the patch that gets me back into those size 36 pants.</p>
      <h2><a name="THE ROYALS">THE FIGHTING TEXAS AGGIES</a></h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I've suffered with the Aggies for years. This past
      weekend, they went up to Kansas State, to play a contest that I fully
      expected them to lose. Instead, they jumped out to a 14-0 lead.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Of late, the Aggies have played a pretty good game
      for 58 of the 60 minutes in the contest. The last minute of each half,
      they have looked like their nerves have overwhelmed their other talents.
      Against Notre Dame, they gave up a touchdown in the final minute of the
      first half. Against Colorado, they have up a touchdown at the end of the
      first half, and then fumbled away an opportunity to win in the final
      minute, resulting in a touchdown.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Against KState, the Aggies gave up a last minute
      touchdown in the first half. My new cheering strategy is to try to get a
      big lead so that the final minute collapse won't cost them the game. There
      was a lot of wind in Manhattan KS and the team that was moving into it had
      a tough time. Some years ago, I was talking to Tom Landry about football,
      and I remember saying, &quot;Damn it, Tom! How many times do I have to say
      it? The name of the game is field position!&quot; Actually, I never had a
      conversation with Old Stone Face, and he already had a deep appreciation for field
      position. On a windy day, one team can punt 60 yards and the other team
      can only punt 30 yards. In the 2nd quarter, A&amp;M played back on their
      heels, and were fortunate to go into the locker room up 14-7.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">In the 3rd quarter, two things became clear. One was
      that KState was losing players to injury almost every series. The other
      was that A&amp;M had one of those amazing streaks where, in the span of
      just over 2 minutes, KState committed 3 turnovers. The Ags converted those
      into 17 points, and took a 31-10 lead.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">KState has had two great kickers the last few years,
      but they are the only team I've seen that has more trouble kicking than
      A&amp;M. One field goal and one extra point were low line drives that
      barely got thru the goal posts. Hey, I'd rather be lucky than good, and
      four points is four points.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">A&amp;M has some serious problems in the offensive
      line. With a talented quarterback, a stable of runners, and a pack of wide
      receivers, I expect more offense. On most plays, someone from the other
      team is in the Aggie backfield, stifling the run and forcing rushed
      passes. During the second half, A&amp;M's offense never showed up,
      averaging less than two yards per offensive play. KState stormed back into
      the game, against the wind.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">They scored with 11 minutes to go, making it 31-17.
      They scored again with 4 minutes to go, making it 31-24. A&amp;M responded
      with a &quot;three and out&quot; series on offense, and then KState got a
      great punt return to the Aggie 20.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The rest of the game was a contest of strength, with
      KState trying to avoid losing their 4th straight game, and A&amp;M trying
      to keep them out of the end zone. The excitement peaked in the final
      minute, when the Aggie defense actually held them off inside the 5 yard
      line, allowing the
      offense to run out the final seconds.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">These guys are driving me batty, and making very hard
      to nap during their games. It appears that despite our problems, the
      Aggies have plenty of heart, and that's all that enabled them to survive
      the furious finish by the KState Wildcats. I swear that we are the worst
      6-1 football team I've ever seen. I'd rather be lucky than good, and 6-1
      is 6-1. By clinching a bowl berth, the team earned over a million dollars
      for the athletic department.</p>
