<h1>TUESDAY AFTERNOON NEWS</h1>
<h2>My Weekend In The Air:<br>
Post 911 Air Travel</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">18 September 2001</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Last week, a series of terrorist attacks took place in the
US. I call it 911, after the date of the attacks, September 11.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Air travel was difficult, frustrating, dysfunctional, slow, expensive,
and I’m really glad I went.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Pre-911 air travel wasn’t really all that great. Too many
airlines and too many planes chased too few fares. We were spiraling down to a
very common denominator of unreliable schedules, unprofessional services, and
surly passengers. Air rage was epidemic, planes were late, communication was
bad. Travelers received announcements skeptically when told about the need to
wait for weather. Some fool in the FAA kept backing up the whole country
whenever it rained between Chicago and any other city.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">People would be boarded on planes and then sit at gates or
on tarmacs for hours. Flights would arrive and find other planes at their gates,
and the passengers would wait forever. I once saw a husband and wife decide to
avail themselves of the lavatory after everyone was on the plane. We couldn’t
pull back from the gate until they were seated. Two hundred and fifty people in
our plane alone had to wait to move until Mr and Mrs I-Can’t-Wait finished
taking their sweet time. <b>People, I know that your mothers told you this: go <i>before</i>
you leave</b> – but she meant before you get on the plane, dammit. I was
reminded of the belief that a butterfly in China, flapping its wings, might
create a tornado in the US the next day. I wondered if this guy’s bladder was
going to be the space that delayed a thousand ships.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I’m normally very conscientious about getting to the
airport an hour before the scheduled departure time, especially if I am checking
a bag. I would prefer to walk straight from my car to the plane and then take
off immediately, but the airlines discourage that. So I always get there early,
and watch the other passengers jockey to get ahead of each other, for space in
the overhead, for exit row seats, for a drink at the water fountain. The size of
carry on bags had gotten so far past ridiculous. I’ve decided to volunteer to
be the line Nazi and the Carry on Bag Judge. I bought a bag that fits into that
little box because I know that rules are for everybody. A lot of times I felt
like I was the only person on the plane who was carrying a bag that complied
with the rules. My sense of fairness was as offended as it is when people come
from nowhere to buy movie tickets when the person in front of me gets to the
window. I like a straight line and no cutting. I’m willing to wait my turn but
if you want to pass me, I’m going to get surly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s even worse in cars, when a lane is closed or two
highways merge. All of the good guys merge early, and then the yahoos fly around
them and try to cut in way ahead. That makes me pretty testy, too. I want to
have a big semi and block both lanes. <b>Kids, I know that your mothers told you
to take turns</b>. Stop trying to cut in lines. If you’re in such a damned
hurry, leave home earlier. If you try that, you might not get that look from
your wife when you make her five minutes late for everything. Stop stealing
other people’s time when you waste so much of your own.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN A. I attend three genealogy conferences each year. The
FGS conference was scheduled last week in the Quad Cities. I made plans to drive
from Fort Worth to Davenport and camp the whole way up and back, like John
Wilbanks did for the NGS conference in Portland. I was scheduled to attend a
board meeting on Tuesday, and to speak on Friday and Saturday. In between, I’d
be able to visit with all of my genealogy buddies that I get to see three times
a year.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Events don’t always go like I want. I thought that a
commemoration event in College Station, TX observing the passing of my old
college advisor, Manuel Davenport, had been scheduled for the prior weekend.
When the event was finalized, it was on the 15<sup>th</sup>, and conflicted with
my scheduled luncheon talk. I was asked to participate in the commemoration
event. Having been away at FGS last year when he passed, and having missed the
memorial service, I really wanted to participate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Discussions with the GENTECH board led to the cancellation of the planned
Tuesday meeting.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN B. I decided that I needed to be at the Commemoration
in Texas. I saw no reasonable way I could drive from Iowa to A&amp;M between
noon Friday and 8 am Saturday, so I made plans to find other speakers to give my
scheduled talks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This was a great idea, except that it didn’t work. I was
able to recruit Dick Eastman to do the Saturday luncheon, but Bill Mumford was
going to need an $800 plane ticket to do the Friday talk.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN C. It was determined that I could be flown up and back
for just under $300, and the society bought the ticket. Even though I live very
near the DFW airport, it was decided that I would fly out of (and back in to)
the Houston airport because it was nearer to College Station. I was to fly on
Wed, 12 Sept, to Minneapolis and then Moline, and leave Friday after the talk on
the GEDCOM TestBook, and be in Houston by 730pm the 14<sup>th</sup>. I’d stay
with my parents in Katy and get to A&amp;M by 830 am on Saturday for the
commemoration event. I also planned to drive down the night before and stay
there, so I could get to the airport good and early the next day.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">That plan was a good one, in terms of how long it lasted
until it changed. Actually, it lasted MUCH longer than any other plan from then
until I got home.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN D. Tuesday morning, the 911 attack grounded the civil
aviation industry. I checked the NWA website and found that my flight for
Wednesday morning was cancelled. I called the airline and was re-booked on a
flight for Wednesday at 1pm. Many announcements pertaining to civil aviation
were made that day, including the elimination of curbside baggage checking and
the prohibition of knives on planes. I carry a small Swiss army knife – I need
it to cut through shrink wrap on software. The blade is about two inches long,
and it would be impossible to threaten anyone with it unless they swallowed it,
I think. Geez, I felt sorry for everybody that day. Dead people, bereaved loved
ones, all of us. I called my kids, I called my parents, I called my friends. I
emailed all the mailing lists I’m on. I really wanted to connect with
something that wasn’t burning, collapsing, or crashing.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I packed my pocket knife into my checked luggage, certain
that I wouldn’t be allowed to take it on the plane. Frankly, I don’t like to
have to clear security at airports. My belt buckle or my shoes set it off. Some
guy always picks my laptop to do the swab test. In Kansas City, you have to
clear security to get to the gates for a boarding pass. Then you have to go out
of the secure area to reach the rest rooms or any food. The frequent delays
mentioned above led to the need for me to clear security at MCI many times. On
one trip, the same guy swabbed my laptop 4 times. I took to traveling with a
fanny pack, so I could just dump the metallic objects in my pockets – phone,
palm pilot, change, pens, wristwatch, Swiss army knife, you name it – into the
fanny pack and send it through with my carryon. Of course, if I took anything
out of the pack before the plane left, it would initiate a series of events that
would result in my having to go out and back thru and put it away again –
perhaps the air gods were testing me. They’d delay a flight because I had a
pocketknife in my pocket, leading me to decide to eat before the flight. Then
the food vendor would give me change, and I’d have to be sure to put that away
too. I tell you, life is complicated for the absent-minded, and I find security
checks to be a royal pain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of my daughters was in Rome, and by coincidence, she
emailed me at that exact time. I knew then that she was in a coffee shop in
Rome, and as long as she is at large, freedom and democracy still have a chance.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Wednesday morning, it was announced that the FAA would rule
on whether the groundstop would be lifted at 12 eastern time. I really wanted to
fly by that point, because I wanted to see my genealogy family, too. I left at
6am and drove to the airport in Houston. I stopped for gasoline and coffee and
decided to wash my car. I’m really losing control of the mess that my car is
becoming and it seemed like a good day to get my rolling house in order, so I
spent 15 minutes waiting and then driving through the station’s car wash. Then
I drove on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As I passed through Huntsville, about 50 miles from the
airport, at 1015 or so, I called NWA again and was told that if I checked in
early, that the flight was still on. If the FAA lifted the groundstop, I’d be
on my way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I sped on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I had forgotten two things, and they didn’t come to my
mind until later. One is that I have a big old box of chewing gum at home. I got
it at Costco. I chew a lot of gum in the car. I chew it for about ten minutes,
then get some more. I think it might be what makes me such a great driver, but
then again, these things aren’t always easy to understand, much less explain.
The other thing that I forgot was that on the Thursday before I left, my home
computer network had crashed. The computers all worked, but I couldn’t get
them to see each other the way that they had before. I was without clue to the
cause or solution. I resolved to wait until I got home before I fooled with it,
but then I talked to my brother and he said to bring the computers with me when
I came down. When PLAN C became PLAN D, I forgot about the computers because I
wasn’t going to Katy first anymore. Or so I thought.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I took the Hardy Toll Road and that put my trip’s toll
meter at $1. I got to the airport, parked in the City Economy Lot, and took the
bus to Terminal B. I’ve never been comfortable calling it Terminal Parking, or
doing anything that starts with the word Terminal. I tipped the shuttle driver a
dollar, putting the total of tips for the trip at $1. As I arrived at the
counter, the airline employees were leaving. “No flights today. It’s all
cancelled.” I asked if I could book my next flight, and they said that I’d
have to call, they couldn’t help me. When I rode the bus back to my car, I
didn’t offer a tip.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN E. I don’t mind making it clear that Northwest
Airlines was the author of my discontent. I made many calls to three different
toll free numbers. These are daytime minutes on my cell phone, mind you, and
they have a system that answers, thanks you for calling northwest, tells you
that they’re busy as hell, and then asks you several other questions before
giving you a busy signal. After about 45 minutes, almost all of which I think
went on my cell phone, I got through and made a reservation for the same 1pm
flight on Thursday, with the same return flight as before. While I was doing all
of this calling, I was driving to Katy to see my folks. I figured I’d be there
for the night. That’s two more toll booths, the trip total is at $3 now.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I should also mention that everyone knows me as Beau, my
nickname. My driver’s license says James. This occasionally causes me problems
when I want to board a plane. I expected some trouble this time.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My brother was out golfing, so I had lunch with my parents,
did a little email at their office, and went to their house to nap – having
left to early and all. I should add that I had the radio or the TV on news
everywhere I went, because I wanted to know what was going on in the world. I
felt like it was bigger than Pearl Harbor. We’ve avoided dealing with Terror
for 20 years, and our hens are home to roost now.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN E wasn’t a bad plan, I would like to have tried it.
About 1 or 2 pm, I found that my substitute speaker, Dick Eastman, wasn’t
going to be able to get to Quad Cities and that I was back on the hook for the
Saturday luncheon. I called the Philosophy Department at A&amp;M and told them
that I had the prior commitment come back up, and that if I was able to fly to
Quad Cities that I would stay through Saturday and miss the commemoration event.
I also heard that people who were grounded in Chicago and other hubs were
renting cars and driving the rest of the way, resulting in a shortage of rental
cars in the Midwest.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was about this time that I realized what a virtuoso
performance that Rudy Giuliani was putting on. Had he pursued his Senate bid
last fall, he wouldn’t have been in NYC when the 911 Attack started. He was
everywhere, he was laying it on the line. He was at risk, he cared, he worked
long days. When I grow up, I want to have Rudy’s grace under pressure.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN F. That evening, I was playing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>42 with my parents when my cell phone rang, maybe at 10pm. I received an
automated message from Northwest telling me that my flight was cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I called them and things got really difficult. There was no way that they
could get me to Moline before my lecture at 8am on Friday morning. The best I
could do was to fly to Memphis at 7pm, connect to Minneapolis, get there at
11pm, and drive to Davenport. At that time, I moved my return back. Sunday
wasn’t available, but Monday was. I took it. Then I booked a rental car in
Minneapolis for a one-way trip to Davenport with Hertz.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">About 11pm, my brother came in and asked me if I had
brought the computers. It was the first time I had thought about them in about
36 hours. I felt pretty silly. He wanted to work on them in his “hospital.”
I wish I had taken them to him. Nobody likes to have their LAN down.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next day, I got up and went to work at my parent’s
office. I called and asked for the conference planners in Davenport to move my
lecture back on Friday in case I got there later in the day. I cleaned up in the
afternoon and went back to the airport for the second time. This involved
raising the tolls to $5 for the trip to date. I parked at the same lot and
tipped another dollar. Tolls $5, Tips $2. I hope to buy my way to Davenport, one
dollar at a time. When I used to have money, I’d tip $5. People remember you
for a fin. They forget you for a buck, right after the curse leaves their
whispering lips. I noticed that there were no planes landing or taking off as I
rode the bus to the terminal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">This time I’m at the airport at 4pm, a full three hours
before the flight. I got right up to the counter, there was no line. I checked
my bags. I expected them to be searched, but they weren’t searched in my
presence, and I have locks on them. The man at the gate said that the Memphis
leg would be easy, but he wasn’t sure about the second leg to Minneapolis,
because most flights were just for repositioning. They were understanding about
the name on my ticket being different from my ID, and waved me right through. I
cleared security, putting my laptop bag and fanny pack through the x-ray machine
like always. It was great. I was at the gate with a boarding pass in hand a full
two and a half hours before my flight. I found a seat near an outlet and plugged
in my laptop. No use wasting so much good time. The first thing I did was see
that it would take all night and then some if I had to drive from Memphis. I
looked at several routes to Davenport from Minneapolis, and steeled my resolve
to drive all night without sleep.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The snack areas were all outside of the security check.
There was no way to get a soda or a roll without going back out. There were two
uniformed Houston police sitting in the gate area, but they are smiling and
relaxed and kept the tension from getting any higher than normal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I first saw kiosk carts at Faneuil Hall in Boston’s
Quincy Market. Now they’re in most malls, too. They put them right down the
center and clog up traffic. I’ve even seen an Earthlink kiosk here at the
outlet mall in Grapevine. Well, Northwest has a “rebooking hotline” kiosk.
It’s on wheels. They roll it wherever they need, it, and plug it into the
wall, and people can use it to call for flights when one is cancelled. If you
are ever waiting for a plane and one of these kiosks is rolled up near you and
plugged in, this is a bad thing. About 630, that’s what happened to me and
PLAN F.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It was announced that the FAA had reimposed the groundstop
and that all flights that day were cancelled. No one would fly this day from
that terminal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN G. I used the rebooking hotline to rebook for a Friday
morning flight. This put me into the Moline Airport at 220, and my lecture was
rescheduled for 830. This delay really took the steam out of me. I left the
airport, rode the bus back to my car. Again, I did not tip. Get me on the plane
and I’ll tip, I thought.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Driving back to Katy added two more dollars to the toll
total. I’m at 7 and 2 now, and running low on singles. I went to bed, knowing
I’d need to be up very early to catch that plane.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The next day, I got up and got going. We had an early,
quiet breakfast at my parents’ house. I got gas, got through the traffic, paid
two more tolls, parked, tipped one more dollar, (9,3) and entered the gates of
hell. The NW counter had a line at check in that stretched out of sight. I
resolved to visit the men’s room and get some coffee before I got in it. That
didn’t take long. The line, however, didn’t move. I saw two people working
the regular line, and one working the first class line. A lot more people got
into the first class line than would fit on one plane, but I assumed that some
of them were people who believe that they belong in the short line. People live
by their values and convictions, I suppose. I was in the line, moving slowly,
for just over 2 hours and 15 minutes. The people in the line were polite and
trying to be nice to each other. Apparently the 745 plane left, and that
encouraged me. My flight was scheduled for 940 and I got in line at 650am. At
9am, they made a new line for people who were only going to Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">About ten minutes after that, they announced a new policy
of only flying to hubs, and people with connections would not fly this day. They
had too many people and planes in Minneapolis. They didn’t want to get people
out to non-hum cities and not bring them back. It sounded shallow to me. I was
really crushed. I was angry. People had been checking in for connecting flights
for two hours and when I was 20 people from the counter they were going to
change the policy? Here I was with $12 in tolls and bus tips and they were
saying that I wouldn’t fly that day? I decided to stay in line, and see what
my choices were when I got to the counter. I called Davenport and told them that
I had a problem, and learned that my talk was actually scheduled for Saturday,
so I could arrive any time I wanted. A few minutes later, a woman from NWA asked
if there was anyone in line holding a ticket for flight 1051. I thought for
about half a second and stepped forward.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN H. I explained that I had been booked to Moline
before, but that I had cancelled that leg, and had a rental reserved in
Minneapolis. I was in possession of a boarding pass from the evening before that
was for the Memphis/Minneapolis flight only, and I thought that my chances of
getting to the Twin Cities were good. I figured that I could rent a car there if
it came to it, but I also thought that the puddle jumper that I was booked on
might be flying, and might want a passenger. The lady was skeptical, but she
booked me, after an admonition about flying under my nickname. At 920 I got to
the gate and at 930 we boarded an airplane. I called ahead and asked for a car
to be rented round trip, just in case the airline didn’t fly and in case my
one way car reservation was cancelled.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">We took off and flew. I was way in the back. I asked the
flight attendant if she was nervous, and she said she was just ready to get
home. The crew had been stuck in Houston for three days. I told her that if she
had any problems on the flight to ask me for help. I think that the crew is
there for the safety of the passengers, but that the passengers have to watch
out for the safety of the crew, too. This plane was about 20 percent full. The
flight was uneventful. I slept when I could, and worried about what to do in
Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My connection was scheduled for 1pm, and we landed at about
1215. I knew I would have to claim bags and check in, but 45 minutes might be
enough. Our gate had a plane in it. As a matter of fact, there were planes
everywhere at Minneapolis. One at every gate, and dozens more parked in long
neat rows. I didn’t count them, but there must have been over 50 more planes
than gates on Friday in Minneapolis. Eventually, we were assigned to another
gate, and we deplaned. I walked around the concourse. The airport was packed.
The domestic check in line was much longer than the line in Houston. I was sure
that it would take me a couple of hours to go through it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I asked a woman in a NW jacket what I should do. She told
me to claim my bags and check in. I figured that I could claim my bags, call NWA,
and then either check in or catch the bus to Avis. Driving would put me into
Davenport about 6pm.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN I. As I waited for my bags to come up, I called NWA,
and learned that the “no connections” policy had been rescinded, and that I
could fly to Davenport. It was too late for the 1pm flight, but there was one at
435. I could return on my regular flight. I was glad to hear this because it put
me into the Quad Cities at the same time as driving and saved me the expense of
a rental. I got some more money, ate lunch, called the people checking on me,
and started the long march from Concourse F to Concourse C. If you have to make
that switch, start early. It’s far. I felt better than I had at any time since
the 911 Attack. I would see my friends, give my talks, and things would be
normal again.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">PLAN J, PLAN K. My 435 flight was delayed until 510, and
then 500. At 5 we really boarded, and really took off. Iowa and Minnesota were
very green. I rode near a young man who worked for Channel 8 in the Quad Cities.
He’d been stuck in LA for three days, poor devil. We landed in Davenport,
where he learned that his car had likely been towed. He wasn’t sure where
he’d parked it, but there was a list of license tag numbers for cars that were
“relocated.” He couldn’t remember his tag number, either. I am tempted to
report persons with such bad memories to security, but I was sure this guy was
okay.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The shuttle took me to the hotel. I tipped the driver $5
(9,8). When I came in the door, I was immediately hugged by Joe Brickey. I went
to my room, and started to unpack and plan the next two days. Part one of my
flying weekend was over.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What is this Battle of the Network Vowels? CNN and Fox are
spelling the name of the terrorist leader as Osama and Usama. For a spelling
fanatic like myself, this is a serious problem.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Davenport and Moline are great towns. They have a great
river and cool trains. On Saturday, there was a rally in Davenport where 5,000 Americans
showed up, talking unity. A Muslim read prayers. I thought that was so
important – it is imperative that we don’t let this degenerate into Crusades
2001, where the Christians and the Moslems go to war again. This is self-defense
for Live and Let Live. Crimes have been committed and men must pay for those
acts. This particular event also produced donations of $18,000 for the Red
Cross, even though the event was not a fund raising event. I’m a river nut and
I tell you that Mississippi is a river that Americans can be proud of.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Saturday, I saw so many of my genealogy friends. I always
enjoy seeing David Rencher, Tony Burroughs, Michael LeClerc, Pamela Boyer
Porter, Amy Johnson Crow, Tony Burroughs, Rhonda McClure, Jennifer (and Blaine)
Schmidt), Curt Witcher, Matthew and April Helm, Dean Hunter, Karen Green, Birdie
Holsclaw, Jim and Paula Warren, Sandy Clunies, Lou Szucs, Tony Burroughs,
Julianna Smith and many others. Cyndi Howells,
Bob Anderson, Laura Prescott Duffy, Sandi Hewlett and I stayed
up 'til 2am playing pool. Before that we made paper airplanes. Before that we played bridge, or a
variation on bridge that includes teaching beginners through table-talk and, at
times, showing our cards. Hey, sometimes we give do-overs in pool, too.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sunday afternoon, I rode to the airport with a friend who
was flying out. There was a porter at the sidewalk. I gave him a dollar (9,9)
and said that I knew it was hard for a man to make a dollar this weekend. Then
the shuttle driver for my hotel came and I tipped him $5 (9,14). Sunday evening,
I enjoyed dinner with an old high school friend. I also heard my first horn
honked in anger by a driver. Things were returning to normal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Yesterday
morning in Moline, it was overcast and drizzly. I got to the airport early,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>tipped the shuttle driver a dollar (9,15) checked my bags, cleared
security, and then went to my gate. It was at the end of a long concourse and
the three sides were all glass. As I put down my bag, I looked down the
Mississippi Valley. It was green. More trees than I could count. More leaves
than I could count. And off across the runways, near the tree line on the far
side, a huge flock of black birds was flying up and down, in those kaleidoscopic
patterns that only birds can make. It struck me - how much of life and earth are
oblivious to our insanity. It was one of those zen moments when I was at peace
with nature, and felt like I was outside the cycles of lunacy that were blaring
out of a tv set every 30 yards in the airport.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">My
flight to Minneapolis on the puddle jumper was uneventful. I slept most of the
way. The Quad Cities airport was nearly empty. Minneapolis seemed normal. The
flight to Houston was almost full. And get this: we were served a snack.
Sandwich, chips, apple. With a plastic knife.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As
I flew home, I realized that there will be over 50,000 people laid off at
airlines soon, perhaps 100,000. People will lose their jobs in the aftermath of
this attack. Companies will go into bankruptcy and merge. The marketplace, like
the surface of water, will absorb this event, waves will radiate out, and then
it will eventually go away. I suddenly wondered if that wasn't part of the plan.
I wondered if there was someone who intended to shake our faith in products -
after all, we are a market society. When we conquered the world in that Game of
Risk known as WWII, we implemented the GATT agreements. We win the world, we
wish for ... Free Trade! We're the world's merchant society. How do you hurt
merchants? Hurt markets.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I
landed in Houston, and claimed my bags. As I left the airport, I passed the NWA
counter. There was no line. If I had seen a ticket agent that I recognized, I
would have gone over there. I would have told them that I made it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I headed straight for DFW. On the way, I had to pay one
more toll – to finish the trip at $10 for tolls and $15 for bus and shuttle
