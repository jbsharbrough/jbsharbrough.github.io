        2002 NFL Playoffs<!--mstheme--></font></h1>
      <p>The biggest single factor in NFL games is injuries. I like to anticipate 
        the playoffs, predicting the entire bracket, but the playoff games are 
        very hard-hitting games. The season ends for the loser, there's so much 
        at stake, and the pros put a little emotion into it for a change. These 
        days the NFL is a gangster league, with players who show up the other 
        team. I remember when Mark Gastineau's Sack Dance irritated people on 
        both teams. No more. There's as much dancing in an NFL game as there is 
        at the half time.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Despite that septic leakage, the Second Season is lots better than the 
        first season. Most years, the Conference Championships are the best games, 
        and the Superbowl is an anticlimax. This year, I expect the same thing. 
        St Louis has found a defense to go with a historic offense. I expect them 
        to run roughshod over whoever the AFC sends to play.</p>
      <p>They play the games for a reason, though. There are going to be some 
        terrific games in this year's playoffs and you won't want to miss them.</p>
      <h2><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold, Arial, Helvetica"> 
        
         
        Wild Card - take the favorite.<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
      <p>In the Wild Card round, you find teams who are just glad to be here, 
        playing against teams who have been there plenty. When that happens, the 
        only way that the young teams can win is if they are like the Niners of 
        the 80's - a great team that just hasn't won yet.</p>
      <p><b>NYJets at Oakland.</b> Last year, I thought that the Jets would get 
        to the Super Bowl, and then they lost Testaverde and never contended. 
        This year, I feel like they are not going anywhere. <i>Raiders.</i></p>
      <p><b>Baltimore at Miami.</b> The defending champs against a team that's 
        becoming a bridesmaid. I like the Miami coach. I like the Miami quarterback. 
        I like the Baltimore defense. I expect both teams to lose in a forgettable 
        game. <i><font color="#FF9966">Miami.</font></i></p>
      <p><b>San Franciso at Green Bay.</b> I think that Green Bay is a pretender, 
        and will lose easily. I hate to see Terrell Owens win anything, but he 
        gets a week to get ready for some real football players in the second 
        round. That's right, it doesn't matter who wins, St Louis destroys them 
        next week. <font color="#FF6699"><i><font color="#FF9966">San Francisco.</font></i></font></p>
      <p><b>Tampa Bay at Philadelphia.</b> Here's an example of how defense can 
        get you to the playoffs, but it takes offense to win once you get there. 
        Tampa Bay hasn't ever moved the ball well enough to get out of the first 
        round. Philly has a fine defense and looks real to me. Give me Liberty 
        or give me death. <i>Philadelphia.</i></p>
      <h2><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial Rounded MT Bold, Arial, Helvetica"> 
        
         
        Divisional Playoffs - take the defense.<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Oakland at New England</b>. 
        Cindarella hosts the Pirates. The Raiders showed a lot of offense, but 
        I don't think they showed enough football team to go another week. New 
        England has suffered long enough. <i>Pats.</i></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Baltimore at Pittsburgh</b>. 
        The Ravens surprised me last week. They shut down the Dolphins completely, 
        and they made 20 points. That same effort would beat the Steelers. This 
        game pits this season's best record in the AFC against the defending Super 
        Bowl champs. I like change, but there's no question who has the best defense. 
        <i>Colts, uh, Browns, uh, Ravens</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Philadelphia at Chicago</b>. 
        I still like the Eagles - they have something strong on both sides of 
        the ball. Chicago showed me a good defense this year, but the gap in the 
        offenses is a lot bigger than the gap in the defenses. And the Bears don't 
        know what to expect. <i>Eagles</i>.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Green Bay at StLouis</b>. 
        Okay, Green Bay surprised me last week. I'm still not going to get off 
        the Rams. Green Bay is the next speed bump that the Rams will go four 
        wheeling over with their monster truck offense. <i>Rams.</i></font></p>

        Conference Championship - take the quarterback.<!--mstheme--></font></h2>
      </font>
      <p>In my personal opinion, these are the best football games of every season. 
        One team reaches the Super Bowl, and the other goes home disappointed, 
        even after a successful season. They leave everything on the field in 
        the Conference Championships. Elway led the Broncos on The Drive in a 
        conference champtionship game. In comparison, the Super Bowl is often 
        a blowout by the NFC and not much of a football game to watch.</p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><b>New England at Pittsburgh</b>. 
        The Steelers have a terrific defense, and a lot of civic pride. It warms 
        my heart to see it. The Patriots are fast becoming the Red Sox - a perennial 
        source of hope and disappointment. Call me crazy, but a team with two 
        quarterbacks has a real advantage, and after the late heroics against 
        the Raiders last week, I expect New England to win a bruising football 
        game.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"><b>Philadelphia at StLouis</b>. 
        I agree with the people who say that Donovan McNabb has been absolutely 
        terrific in the playoffs this season. This is the week that a quarterback 
        often makes the difference. As good as McNabb is, I don't think he's going 
        to be the best quarterback in the room this weekend. Curt Warner is The 
        Answer, there's no question about it.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica"> 
        
        New England vs StLouis in New Orleans. My formula for this year 
        has worked surprisingly well, seeing as it's so simple. I've only picked 
        two games wrong so far. My reason for taking the Rams is simple: they're 
        a better team than they were when they won XXXIV. New England was in this 
        game in '96, and got blown out. The Rams have an opportunistic defense 
        - they aren't stifling, they just make the big play when you least expect 
        it. My pick for MVP is A Williams from the Rams D, in a game decided by 
        two touchdowns. <i><font color="#FF9966">Rams.</font></i></font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">[Note to self: you aren't prescient.
Aeneus Williams was invisible, New England won the battle of the turnovers, and
the game. Let's be honest - StLouis lost the game, 20-17, by giving up 17 points
on turnovers and then yielding an 80 yard field goal drive in the final minute
of the game. A second year quarterback played a mistake-free game, while a
2-time MVP looked like he was scrambling for his life. I'm glad that they play
the games. This one was fun to watch.]</font></p>
