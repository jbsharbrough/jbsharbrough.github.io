<body><h2><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">The Tuesday Afternoon
      News:<br>
It's Odd, in the End.</font></h2>
      <font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">
      <p class="MsoNormal">16 October 2001</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Today I want to discuss three topics: RAM Prices,
      Making Peace, and the Kansas City Royals.</p>
      <h2>RAM PRICES</h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I can remember hoping that hard drives would fall to
      a dollar a megabyte. Now they're something like $0.0025/MB, and RAM is
      going for $0.20/MB. Windows is a pig for RAM, and having lots of it helps
      anyone using Windows get some real advances.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">For Win95, you need 64MB minimum. For Win98/ME, go up
      to 128MB minimum. For Win2000, go for everything your motherboard can
      hold.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Speaking of motherboards, not everyone can add the
      RAM that they're selling today. I don't think it's a good idea to buy a
      new computer because you want to add some RAM, but you might find that you
      have to have a new motherboard to hold more. And that motherboard might or
      might not have the right number and type of slots for your expansion
      cards. Think ahead, and help yourself.</p>
      <h2><a name="MAKING PEACE">MAKING PEACE</a></h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">I woke up the other day realizing that we can't have
      peace unless our moderate Arab friends take a stand for us. They should
      tell their people that we are nice guys. If they don't do this, we'll find
      that the people over there are making up monster stories about us, and no
      balanced message will get out.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Then I started to think about foreign aid. How we
      give lots of money to the people who say we're so bad. I looked up the
      amounts of foreign humanitarian and military aid that we give. Of course,
      there's a lot of that, but then I started to wonder if we don't allow a
      trade imbalance - it's kind of the same thing as sending aid. Wow. The US
      trade imbalance was over $400 billion last year. Wow. The Apollo program
      cost $25 billion. That used to be the cost of oil we imported every year.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">When we finish winning this war we better get our
      trade in balance or we'll ship out everything we own and won't have
      anything left for our kids to waste. It wouldn't bother me if we'd start
      working on alternative fuels so we could kick that addiction to Middle
      Eastern Oil that we're feeding.</p>
      <h2><a name="THE ROYALS">THE ROYALS</a></h2>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Of course, the Royals are already a joke for
      pretending that Tony Muser is a major league manager. Guys, there are only
      30 openings in the world for this job, why are you sticking with a guy who
      is clearly number 2,000? At least three announcers and one lawyer have
      already done better.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Jamie Quirk was bench coach for the Royals, and had
      the temerity to openly discuss how stupid Muser is during the games. Jamie
      is also a longtime close friend of Hall of Famer George Brett, who is a
      front office executive with the Royals. Muser went to his boss, GM Allen
      Baird, and probably whined about how hard it was to keep the thing going
      with Jamie telling the truth about him.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">While Brett was out of town on 9 October, Baird fired
      Quirk, who had been in that position for 8 years, because according to
      Baird, the team needed &quot;an adjustment&quot; at bench coach. The team
      needs an adjustment all right, but this soap opera is ... well, for
      entertainment it's better than anything else in baseball that doesn't have
      Steinbrenner in it. Baird meets with Muser for the weekend, then fires
      Brett's pal and keeps the rest of the coaches.&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Muser makes the worst decisions in the game of
      anybody I can think of. I'm not surprised that he blames his bench coach
      for his lack of a clue, but I'm astounded that an organization with the
      class of the 80's Royals can fall this far. Allen Baird, if you want to
      make the team better, why don't you fire your non-coach and then resign
      for the classless way you work. I think that removing two negatives would
      be a positive.</p>
