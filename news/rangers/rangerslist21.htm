<p>I didn't mean to imply that Mike Lamb isn't a good ballplayer. I'm sorry if
  I confused anyone. What I meant was that it appeared that he overreacted
  when he made an error - that he got down on himself. I think you need to
  have a short memory when you make a mistake - put it behind you and get
  ready to make another one.</p>
<p>Attached, please find one break, just like you requested.</p>

  Since when does batting .313 constitute sucking as a
  baseball player? The guy can hit - maybe he's not a
  power hitter yet, maybe his defense is lacking right
  now, but he can hit. His defense will only get better,
  as well as his hitting. Who would you rather have? Ken Caminiti? Dean Palmer? Maybe Scooter Sheldon out there
everday? Yeah, that sounds good! The guy hit .280 his
  rookie year and is hitting well over .300 now. If
  that's sucking, let me know what is not sucking. Gimme
  a break.</p>

  &gt; Hello to the List, Happy Saturday!<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Gosh it was hot at the ballpark. The flags drooped on their poles and so did&nbsp;
the fans. The paid crowd was 47,000, but I think&nbsp; that 35,000 watched the&nbsp;
game. The rest took their bobble head Nolan Ryan&nbsp; dolls and went home to&nbsp;
watch the game in the air conditioning.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; We ducked under one bouncing foul ball in a frantic&nbsp; effort to avoid being&nbsp;
killed by it. NetMan got one and missed one.&nbsp; We got one of those tshirts that they shoot into the&nbsp;
air, but it had hit the&nbsp; ground, and we gave it away, covered in pieces of&nbsp;
peanut shells.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; I agree with GaryC, that Khad K Kurtis looks about 4&nbsp; feet 10 up at the&nbsp;
plate. I'm thinking Eddie Gaedel. I stopped seeing&nbsp; Chad as a ballplayer&nbsp;
about a year ago. He's a court jester now. You have&nbsp; to imagine the hat, but&nbsp;
the rest is easy.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Juan Gonzalez took a base on balls. Really.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Pudge Rodriguez has a great arm. It's easy to take&nbsp; it for granted, but twice&nbsp;
last night he used that arm to make very nice plays.&nbsp; There was the 1-2-3&nbsp;
double play to end the second (killing a bases&nbsp; loaded, no out rally), and&nbsp;
there was a topper in front of the plate that rolled&nbsp; about halfway to the&nbsp;
mound. Barehand pickup, one motion, batter blown&nbsp; away. Smooth like smoke.&nbsp;
Pudge didn't hit the home run he's been hitting&nbsp; every game lately, but he&nbsp;
did drill a liner deep into right center. It was run&nbsp; down by Juan Gonzalez,&nbsp;
who looked like a ballplayer instead of a&nbsp; weightlifter. Is this a bad time&nbsp;
to remind the list that Juan's agent didn't show any&nbsp; interest in a 6 year&nbsp;
$90 million offer from Doug Melvin in 1999, or that&nbsp; he passed on a 7 year&nbsp;
$119 million offer from Detroit?&nbsp; You know, if we were going to lose him, you could&nbsp;
have your choice of the&nbsp; two picks we'd have gotten in compensation for&nbsp;
whoever signed him, or you&nbsp; could have Kapler, Catalanotto, Cordero, and a pass&nbsp;
at Jason Thompson (I'll&nbsp; ignore the Zaun, Haselman, and Patterson parts of&nbsp;
the deal if it's okay).&nbsp; There's Melvin, trying to trade an outfielder to&nbsp;
get some pitching, and&nbsp; ending up with ... outfielders. Go figure.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Catalanotto is not an outfielder, but he's a good&nbsp; hitter. Like Jamey said&nbsp;
yesterday, he rakes. And I saw him beat out a ground&nbsp; ball to short. Vizquel&nbsp;
charged, made a good throw, and it wasn't close.&nbsp; Catman is as fast as&nbsp;
Palmeiro is slow.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; There's a Bermuda Triangle in shallow left field.&nbsp; Several popups were hit&nbsp;
there and we were close enough to hear ARod say, &quot;I&nbsp; can't see it.&quot;
ARod,&nbsp; Lamb, and Catman converged each time, and it was an adventure whether anyone&nbsp;
would actually catch the ball. Lamb got the first&nbsp; one and Catman the second.&nbsp;
Doug Davis might want to have the opponents hit&nbsp; their popups somewhere else.&nbsp;
Once that ball starts falling, I think it will fall&nbsp; a lot. Heck, teams might&nbsp;
start aiming popups there to take advantage of the&nbsp; confusion those guys are&nbsp;
having.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Poor Mike Lamb struggled last night. He struggled&nbsp; with the glove, he&nbsp;
struggled with the bat, and he struggled with that&nbsp; demon that was telling&nbsp;
him he sucks at baseball. He made two throws that&nbsp; looked like the ball just&nbsp;
flew out of his hand, one dribbled to first and got&nbsp; the guy out, the other&nbsp;
sailed into right field, reminding me of my own pony&nbsp; league days. We had the&nbsp;
great misfortune to sit two rows in front of those&nbsp; clowns who know&nbsp; everything there is to know about baseball. Well,&nbsp;
everything except certain&nbsp; facts, like the pronunciation of Teixiera, for&nbsp;
instance. We showed great&nbsp; self control by not turning around and beating the&nbsp;
pie out of them. These&nbsp; people rode Lamb and he could hear it. The point to&nbsp;
this ramble is that I&nbsp; suspect that Mike Lamb has to get himself under&nbsp;
control before he can get to&nbsp; that next level where he plays to his ability. He&nbsp;
looks pretty good for a&nbsp; number 8 hitter.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Kapler smoked a double inside the bag at third, and&nbsp; I think he was surprised&nbsp;
because he didn't start running until he was halfway&nbsp; to first. Then he ran&nbsp;
like hell, and it's clear what a jock he is when he&nbsp; runs all out. His homer
was deep in the left field stands, gone from the time it left the bat.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; This would be a good time to add that Narron is a steely eyed missle man.
His handling of Davis in the 7th was something we haven't seen here in a while. A manager went to the mound and showed
confidence in a young pitcher in a tough spot late in a game. Wearing a Texas uniform.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Martha, we didn't see you. Maybe next time.<br>
