</pre>
<p>Hello to the list,</p>
<p><u>GaryC opined</u>:<br>
  If he increases his pitiful walk total or his subpar power, adjust
  accordingly. Certainly his perceived value is a lot higher than his actual
  value right now.</p>
<p><br>
<u>
  I further opine</u>:<br>
  8 walks in 200 trips ain't a lot of walks, I'll agree. I also think that
  it's misleading to isolate a stat like that.</p>
<p>It sounds like a second year player doesn't get much slack around here. For
  a team that is rebuilding, I'd like to suggest that a second year player
  with a 320 average doesn't sound that common to me. We might see some 2nd
  year players in the next two years who look more like Mateo than Lamb. Guys
  like ARod and The Big Hurt are exceptions. Mere mortals don't do that much.
  I don't expect Lammer to do it either. But I'm not going to isolate the good
  average and claim that Lamb is a good hitter. Let's compare average, on base
  average, and slugging percentage for some players in their second years. Not
  everyone plays every day and I've tried to reasonably choose a season to
  call the &quot;second year&quot; for some players even thought it was their 
  fourth
  season.</p>
<p>I'll grant that this is an offensive era, and that 1988 numbers and 2001
  numbers are not straight up the same, and I'll grant further that ballparks
  make a difference, too. Please consider that and look at these numbers.</p>
<p>Some other Rangers and their second year stats:</p>

<p>Forgive me if I don't include Ledee and Mateo.</p>
<p>
  Some other current AL 3rd basemen, in their second year:<br>
  Brosius, 1994, 238, 289, 417<br>
  Koskie, 2000, 300, 400, 441 (nice numbers)<br>
  Ripken, 1983, 318, 371, 517 (also nice numbers. Certain HOFer)<br>
  J Valentin, 1995, 219, 293, 402<br>
  Chavez, 2000, 277, 355, 495 (OPS is 50 points lower this year)<br>
  Fryman, 1991, 259, 309, 447<br>
  Randa, 1997, 302, 366, 451 (I like this player)<br>
  Glaus, 1999, 240, 331, 450<br>
  Vinnie Castilla, 1995, 309, 347, 564 (people do slug in Denver. Hasn't
  slugged 500 for a season since 1998)</p>
<p>Forgive me if I don't include David Bell. And forgive me if I don't include
  error totals - but some of them were ugly.</p>
<p>What's my point, those of you who are number-numb might ask? My point is
  that we could say anything we are saying about Mike Lamb's power and on base
  percentage about almost all of these guys. Only 4 of them slugged 495 or
  better in the second year. Only 3 of them had OBA above Lamb's to date for
  their second year.</p>
<p>I guess I just don't understand what yardstick we're going to measure young
  players by here. I'm asking for some patience with young players. In the
  next couple of years, the Rangers will need a lot of it.</p>
