<h2>The 2004 AL West 10 Game Graph</h2>

<p>I'm fond of this graph, even if it's a little busy. There are three parts to 
it: Runs Scored, Wins, and Runs Allowed. The Runs Allowed are graphed as 
negative values, so the best numbers are the highest ones on the graph, just as 
with the Runs Scored. In between these sets of lines are dashed lines showing 
the number of wins in each 10 game span, and they are graphed on the right hand 
axis.</p>

<p>In an average 10 game span, a team would score 45 runs, yield 45 runs, and 
win 5 games. Last year the Angels scored 80 runs in a ten game span, this year 
the Rangers have done it once. As a rule, a variation of 20 runs from average is 
a pretty big one - meaning that 25-65 is the range that holds almost every 
total. Note that the A's are just not giving up many runs.</p>

<p>Oh, and the right-most measurement is not always complete. It might include only 7 
games for Anaheim, and 8 for the other teams, for example. Measuring any 
period less than 10 games is really not comparable to the others at all. You 
never know when Seattle will give up 13 runs in five games, and then give up 14 
in one. Always take the rightmost reading with a grain of salt.</p>
