<p>Hi gang,</p>
<p>GaryC and I found ourselves in sec.41 at the BallPark last
  night. We saw a few things that don't translate as well from TV,
  I thought I'd toss them out.</p>
<p>* Ramon, I mean Nomar is the real deal. He hits, he fields, he's
  awesome. The rest of the tepid RedSox lineup will get you beat
  4-3. This man can throw like Pudge.<br>
  * There was a guy in a dark part of the stands, wearing a
  trenchcoat and hat and smoking a cigarette, who told us the real
  story on Loaiza's hand injury. He says it was not Steve's wife
  who closed the car door on his hand, but a devoted fan, under
  &quot;contract&quot; to pitching coach Dick Bosman. &quot;You throw that
  sidearm sh*t again and I'll break your hand,&quot; Bozz threatened.
  When Stevie didn't get it, someone closed the door on his hand
  and promised that when he came off the dl if he threw any more of
  that sidearm crap it would happen again. I think that this
  smoking guy knows something, because it appears that Steve has
  finally gotten the message. I love creative approaches to
  problems.<br>
  * The following Rangers are hitting the old Al Oliver frozen
  ropes: Gonzalez, Palmeiro, Stevens. Gonzalez and Stevens hit
  doubles that were just about as fast as I've seen a ball get to
  the wall. It's a gravity defying act you've got to see.<br>
  * Palmeiro has 34 homers and 111 rbi. I sent a note about Tom Scheiffer, whose ego cost the Rangers 5 years of enjoying Raffy
  in red, to the smoking man.<br>
  * Pudge and Todd Zeile have temporarily lost it. Neither looks
  comfortable at the plate. Todd in particular can't seem to get
  ready to swing in time. He's still pulling his bat back when the
  ball gets to the plate. His efforts to regroove his swing are
  painful to watch. I saw the Smoking Man shaking his head several
  times.<br>
  * Lee Stevens is so in the leather. TZ pulled him into the
  basepath and he just laid out there and made the play. I thought
  he'd get hit and I know I saw the smoking man write in his
  notepad.<br>
  * The Bosox have a reliever named Garces who looks like he's way
  fat. Don't be deceived. This guy plays defense from foul line
  to foul line and only let one Rangers ground ball out of the
  infield. I think he had one of those nights where everything is
  perfect. I remembered a Rangers rookie, Dreyer I think, chasing
  foul balls all the way to the stands. In case you can't tell it,
  I like enthusiasm on the field.<br>
  * Two balls go off Gonzalez' glove in two nights. I want to get
  a look at that glove. It was a good hustle play by Igor, but a
  long run followed by a muffed catch will get him a baseball
  career that looks a lot like mine. Of course, Igor hits a lot
  better than me. GaryC and I discussed it and I have the arm to
  play GM.<br>
  * I've never been at the park when Zimm pitched. He's wicked
  good. He can throw so low. Last night, a 9 pitch inning, two<br>
  balls.<br>
  * Why does anyone throw a strike to Pudge and Juan?<br>
  * Stano left it wherever Zeile left it.<br>
  * Offerman and Goodwin turned in surprising efforts in the field.&nbsp;<br>
* It appeared that the Red Sox wanted to hit the ball to Rusty
  all night. (That's paranoia speaking. They don't know where it
  will go).<br>
