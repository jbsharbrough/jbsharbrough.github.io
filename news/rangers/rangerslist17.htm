<p>A number of people had a chance to step up for the Rangers last night. Ryan
  Glynn called in sick, and then Myette, Crabtree, Moreno, and Brantley all
  managed to turn opportunity into failure, along with the guys who left 14
  men on base. Fourteen left on base. Fourteen. And bless Ruben Sierra, that
  was a great shot thru the 5 hole!</p>
<p>Getting to the major leagues is hard - there's only about 800 people with
  the job in the whole world. A man doesn't get many chances to prove that
  he's a winner - heck, GaryC and me never got even one try and we weren't
  that good to start with - but frankly if I wanted to see this much human
  frailty I'd start watching &quot;All My Children&quot; again. This club is trying 
  too
  hard - no team could reasonably blow so many opportunities to play baseball
  in one night.</p>
<p>Poor Jerry Narron. I think he's looking at a pretty good team that can't
  sink a three foot putt these days. It's hard to relax them when the demons
  are loose and roaming the countryside. I can imagine that the Rangers locker
  room looks like a scene from Goonies, where they let them eat after midnight
  and the little buggers are swinging from the lights, rioting and getting
  slime all over everything while the Rangers try to act professional.</p>
<p>Wouldn't this be a great time for Tom Hicks to stay away from the team and
  let Doug Melvin do his job? Nothing like a little meddling from the owner
  off the field when things are going so badly on it.</p>
<p>This summer will be one to forget in Arlington. Normally, a crisis is a
  learning opportunity. In this case, no one is paying attention - they're too
  busy putting the leadoff hitter on base, or leaving men on base, or letting
  the ball go thru they legs. Yowie! That was a funny play! Ruben almost saved
  the viewing experience for me.</p>
<p>Well, almost.</p>
<p>Now that Voyager is back from the delta quadrant, maybe we could send the
  Rangers there for 7 seasons.</p>
<p>Evan Grant says it all for me today. http://baseball.dallasnews.com/rangers_stories/375532_0524ranglede.html</p>
<p>Look at the bright side. We could be pulling for the Braves or the Mets.
  Those fans are REALLY hurting.</p>
<p>Johnny Oates created an attitude with this team, and it's going to be a
  while until that attitude goes away. This season is like that plane that
  lost the landing gear yesterday right when it touched down - it's skidding
  down the runway with the wheels off, while the pilot fights to hold it on
  line. Poor Jerry Narron.</p>
