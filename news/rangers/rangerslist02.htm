Subject: Commitment to Defense (long rant)
</pre>
<p>An article about the Rangers' defense in today's <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com" target="_blank"> DaMN</a> started me
  thinking about this whole commitment to defense. I think that it
  has been a smokescreen in the past, a lie to put fans in the
  stands, but I see some hope for it to get better.</p>
<p>When GM Doug Melvin came in and traded Jose Canseco for Otis
  Nixon, he said that he wanted to build a team around pitching and
  defense. Since that time, two power hitters have left via trade (Canseco and Dean Palmer), a starting pitcher has come via free
  agency and left via trade (Ken Hill), and two of the best
  defensive players have left via free agency over money (Kevin
  Elster and Darryl Hamilton).</p>
<p>I have been bothered by the actions of the team during this time
  and I think that the reason is that there is an inconsistency<br>
  between what they say and what they do. On the other hand, their
  behavior has been very consistent to date if you assume that they
  are really about money.</p>
<p>If we assume that the management is trying to build a winner out
  of pitching and defense, then we should see an improvement in
  each area, and an effort to sign and keep the players that are
  seen as being important in that scheme. I don't think that their<br>
  track record has shown that tendency at all. Let's examine these
  four cases -- Canseco, Palmer, Elster, and Hamilton -- and see if
  they have a common thread, and compare it to the team's stated
  goal of building a winner thru pitching and defense.</p>
<p>You can't separate a team's goals from the realities and
  economics of the game. By that I mean that at any given point in
  time, a team has certain assets -- player talents -- and if they
  don't fit into your plans, you have a fiscal obligation to get
  value for them when you part with them. A really obvious case of
  this is the Palmer/Fernando Tatis case. The other side of that<br>
  argument is that you can't trade just because you want to. When
  then-manager Bobby Valentine asked then-GM Tom Grieve to trade
  Pete Incaviglia, he asked him to &quot;trade him for a broken bat.&quot;
  They were not able to get any offers, and cut Swingcaviglia, the
  King of Swing and Miss.</p>
<p><b>DEAN PALMER</b></p>
<p>Dean Palmer had shown 50 homer potential, but never realized it.
  He'd developed into a very steady everyday ballplayer. He<br>
  improved his defense a lot, we really DID forget about Steve Buechele. He improved his average from about 250 to about 280,
  and had streaks where he was unstoppable. Nevertheless, we felt
  that we had seen all there was to Deano, and Tatis, as Gary
  Pearce has pointed out, was not learning anything in Tulsa. So
  we traded Palmer for Tom Goodwin. This is not an even trade.
  The talent difference in the two players is not enough to call it
  anything other that what it is, an impoverishment of the team.
  If you traded a Mercedes for a Cavalier, and they were the same
  age and mileage, you wouldn't call that even, would you? It's
  hard to quantify ballplayers, but I sure that trading one of the
  top two or three third basemen in the league for one of the
  bottom two or three center fielders is not close to even. Palmer
  was also one of the top 25 offensive players in the league, and
  Goodwin is one of the bottom 25 offensive players in the league.</p>
<p>Palmer was traded because a deadline was coming up, free agency
  was coming up, he didn't fit into our plans, and we got a broken
  bat for him. This trade made the team money. Palmer is a $5
  million a year player, Goodwin is a $1.5 million dollar a year
  player. What Melvin did with the $3.5 million that we saved was
  to spin it as a trade for Tatis, too (who the Rangers already had
  and could have played any time they wished). Tatis was just re-signed for the 1998 season for the league minimum of $170,000.
  His salary for 1997 was about $60,000. Did I mention that the
  Rangers paid almost all of Dean Palmer's salary for the rest of
  1998 after the trade? They traded Palmer and a million dollars
  for Goodwin. A Lexus and cash for a Hyundai.</p>
<p><b>JOSE CANSECO</b></p>
<p>It's no secret that Jose was one of my favorite ballplayers. He
  had his good days and bad days, but excitement swirled around
  him, and I think that when he wasn't thinking of his own
  greatness, he was a really great ballplayer. The first $5<br>
  million dollar man, one of the great power hitters of his time,
  and a man who wasn't ashamed to choke up and shorten his swing
  and put the ball on the ground with two strikes and men on base.
  Trading Canseco for Nixon was the first shot fired in the battle
  for defense and pitching here. The Rangers needed Otis Nixon for
  our big outfield, and Canseco was not going to be signable in
  another year anyway. Much was also made at the time that the
  Rangers signed Bob Tewskbury and Fruit Loops (Mickey Tettleton)
  with the money that they saved. That was a convenient fiction.
  The trade was made well before either of those players became
  available. A large number of players were declared free agents
  by a court ruling, salaries for them plummeted, and Fruit Loops
  was available for $500,000 that year.</p>
<p>Nixon was allowed to go free agent after his two years were up.
  Didn't we sign him because he was a key part of our commitment to
  winning with pitching and defense? Why didn't the Rangers keep
  him afterward? Because he was to expensive, or because his
  defense wasn't good enough?</p>
<p><b>DARRYL HAMILTON</b></p>
<p>When Nixon left because of money, we found a cheap free agent we
  could replace him with. Doug Melvin has a talent for finding
  inexpensive talent to help a team. I don't have that confused
  with a talent for building a team. It appears that some<br>
  businessmen think that you can change ballplayers like car parts
  and keep the machine running. Baseball teams are not machines,
  and it ain't like that. Darryl Hamilton was one of the most
  important players on the 1996 AL West Championship team. He led
  off, he played great defense, and he glued the rest of the team
  together. He became one of my favorites.</p>
<p>At the end of the season, the Rangers did not offer him a
  contract. He went to the Giants. Why didn't they try to keep
  him? It made the papers that the owners told Doug Melvin to go
  find another one just like he did the year before. I felt bad
  about it at the time but thinking back on it, it was a decision
  to risk losing ballgames over money. As a fan, this lesson is
  brought home more clearly every year. Letting Hamilton go was a
  public statement that the Rangers wanted to make money more than<br>
  they wanted to win, and that they were NOT trying to build a team around pitching and defense. They were trying to use that as an
  excuse to field a cost effective team, and if they win a few
  games, then team President Tom Schieffer will take credit for<br>
  them anyway.</p>
<p>They tried to replace Hamilton with Damon Buford, who did play
  great defense, but didn't hit his weight. Later, they traded
  Dean Palmer and a sack of money for Tom Goodwin to fill this
  hole. Wouldn't it have made more sense to sign Hamilton? The
  Rangers STILL don't have a center fielder who belongs in the
  majors, and they don't have an effective leadoff hitter, either.</p>
<p><b>KEVIN ELSTER</b></p>
<p>The Kevin Elster story is a great example of the difference in
  what a team tells the public thru the media and what the truth
  really is. Kevin Elster was known for having a great glove, a
  bad bat, and a glass chin. The Rangers signed him knowing this,
  and one of the great things in baseball happened. He gelled with
  Deano and Mark McLemore to become the best defensive infield in
  the American League. With the defensive leadership of Hamilton
  and Elster, and the coaching of Bucky Dent, the Rangers set a
  record for consecutive errorless games.</p>
<p>The funny thing about it, though, was Kevin's hitting. He'd been
  bulking up, and with his new strength and his spot behind Rusty
  Greer and McLemore in the lineup, he started piling up RBI and
  homers. He had 20 homers and 90 RBI in August. Batting ninth. When the Rangers
  clinched with ten days remaining, Kevin stayed in the lineup
  trying to get to 100 RBI. He should have been resting.</p>
<p>I sat by Gary Collard during the playoffs with the Yankees, and
  watched him let ground ball after ground ball go thru that I
  think I could have reached. He appeared really stiff. I began
  to wish for Benji Gil. I didn't know that Benji would not hit
  any better than Goodwin, or that he never went to the right spot
  on relay plays, or that he ran the bases like he was stoned. I
  bet a dollar that Bucky Dent knew the difference in Benji Gil and
  Kevin Elster. I'd bet a dollar that Doug Melvin did, too.</p>
<p>They let Elster go after the 1996 season, and the defense fell
  apart. Nothing was said in the press all year about how much
  better off we would have been with Elster instead of Gil. TODAY,
  they are saying it. They sold a lot of tickets to see a team
  play with a worse defense without even telling the public that
  they knew that the team would be worse. It's like the midway at
  the circus -- you can't believe anything you hear and only half of
  what you see. The Rangers conned the public into seeing the
  defending ALWest champs, and fielded the cheapest team that money
  could buy. If a defense starts up the middle, why did they let
  two key defenders go over money when they had just won the West
  and had a shot at getting better?</p>
<p>I don't believe that the reason was that they wanted to build a
  winner based on pitching and defense. I think it was that they
  wanted to build a money maker. I'm sure that the owners felt
  better on payday until the fans quit coming out.</p>
<p><b>PITCHING</b></p>
<p>Having wondered why the Rangers dump expensive players for
  cheaper ones and call it building defense, I asked myself the
  same question about the pitching.</p>
<p>If they were building pitching, they would try to keep the good ones, in my opinion. But the first year, they lost Roger McDowell
  and Bob Tewksbury while they waited for Rogers to decide to
  sign. The story that they told the press was that they wanted to
  get him signed so they'd know what was left over to pay the other
  players. In retrospect, that's clearly the truth. They weren't
  going to keep good players for a fair amount of money because
  they were going to keep stars at eye-popping salaries and surround
  them with inexpensive warm bodies labeled as pitching and
  defense.</p>
<p>So they let Rogers go and signed Ken Hill. Then what happened?
  They traded Hill for Leyritz and Perisho, and traded Leyritz for
  someone, was it Marc Brandeburg? Rogers was a good pitcher when
  he left here. He's a head case now, but I hope he comes back
  strong.</p>
<p>Last year, they let Stanton and another reliever get away, and
  this year they tried to throw away Bobby Witt. To their credit,
  the signed a really expensive closer, but I think that's the
  bread and circuses attitude of appeasing the masses. It makes no
  sense to me to bring in an expensive closer if you have to gut
  your defense to do it. We didn't need a closer much last year.</p>
<p>In summary, I'm losing interest in a team that seems to say one
  thing and do another. They have promised the fans a winner, but
  they have given the fans entertainment. I like home runs and
  strikeouts, but I'd rather see good baseball than to have those
  things at the expense of sound fundamentals. And I REALLY don't
  like being lied to and treated like I'm too stupid to see thru
  it.</p>
<p>I said that there was reason for hope. That reason is that
  Elster is back this year. There is a new owner on the horizon.
  There is hope that the Rangers will finally do what they have
  promised since the taxpayers of Arlington gave them a nice new
  playground: build a winner around pitching and defense. I'm
  still ready for it, and ready to cheer for the team even if I
  don't like everything that they do every day.</p>
