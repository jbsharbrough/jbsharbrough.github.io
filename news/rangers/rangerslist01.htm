<p>Hello to the group,</p>
<p>The discussion that has been generated by GaryP's Contender assessments
  is good for baseball. Sometimes I forget that there are people who are
  trying to enjoy the game and haven't read Bill James. I'd like to
  suggest a few simple statistics for you to try to find and follow, and
  see if they help you enjoy the sport.</p>
<p>OFFENSE<br>
  -------</p>
<p>RUNS CREATED. There are lots of ways to measure this statistic. It's
  an effort to understand how runs are made, and that's not quite perfect
  yet. Such a measure also requires you to measure the contribution that
  an individual makes to runs, and that's not perfect, either.</p>
<p>RC1. The easiest way to calculate this stat is to take RUNS+RBI-HR.
  It's a very approximate measure and batting order skews the numbers in
  favor of the 3-6 slots. If you perform this function for the Rangers,
  you'll see that the leaders are Gonzalez and Greer, over 120 thru
  yesterday. Newson has 34, and Goodwin has 89. Newson has only batted
  about 150 times, and Goodwin has batted 450 times. Any stat that uses
  AGGREGATE numbers gives people who play a lot a statistical edge of
  people who don't, so there are other ways to compare performances.</p>
<p>RC2. OPS is OnBase Percentage (Hits + Walks)/(AtBats + Walks) +
  Slugging Percentage (Total Bases / AtBats). I like this stat as a rough
  measure of run production. Anyone over 750 is doing pretty good, and
  some players will end up over 1000 at the end of a year some years.</p>
<p>RC3 - RCx. Some people do some other things to these numbers to factor
  in Stolen bases (most figures take caught stealing into consideration
  too), Park factors, and League Normalization. I like every single one
  of these numbers. If you take whatever measure you like, and normalize
  it over your league for the year, a player who is average gets a 1000
  rating.</p>
<p>One warning about comparing offensive stats: You can get to the point
  where the numbers seem to have their own meanings. This is not
  baseball. You can't tell whether people are pitching around a person,
  or whether he spent a month going for low and away breaking balls, by
  looking at any of the standard measures. Will Clark and Juan Gonzalez
  have about the same number of at bats (387/390), and have scored about
  the same number of runs. Their BA is way apart (331/287) and the RBIs
  are way off the other way (51/97). They have about the same number of
  extra base hits, but Clark has 10 more doubles, and Gonzales has 16 more
  homers, and total bases come out 195/218.</p>
<p>Ok, I think that these are really small differences. In almost 400
  trips to the plate, Gonzales has 16 less hits. I know that baseball is
  a marathon where the victory goes to the consistent, but here i think
  that our tools are measuring a difference that isn't very important. I
  think that the extra hit every week that Clark has had hasn't meant much
  to his team. I think that the extra base that Juan has hit for three
  games isn't such a big difference either. Take 8 balls over 4-1/2
  months and have them fall for this guy and go straight at someone for
  that guy and the differences will average out.</p>
<p>The message here is patience. I think that if you look at numbers over
  a four year period or longer, you can get a good reflection of the
  relative talents of a player. Anything less can be the wind and the
  sun.</p>
<p>One last gripe: you can't get these numbers in the local paper. Used
  to be, the Tuesday DaMN would publish walks and you could calculate
  stats yourself. No more. But that's a great way to segue to pitching
  stats.</p>
<p>PITCHING STATS<br>
  ---------------</p>
<p>Here is a wasteland. ERA and Victories are two of the worst ways to
  measure a pitcher's effectiveness. The ways that they decide who &quot;wins&quot;
  the game means that a guy like Wetteland gets a victory every time that
  he fails and the team comes thru for him. And ERA's are skewed in favor
  of the guys who come into innings with some outs already. almost every
  team has higher starter's ERAs than reliever's ERAs and that's because
  reliever's get to pitch a lot of one and two out innings.</p>
<p>It would be really nice if we could see pitching stats just like batting
  stats: Batting average, On base percentage, slugging percentage. I
  would love to the the OPS for pitchers, but I've never been able to find
  the numbers to calculate it. It would be refreshing to have one set of
  numbers, though, for offense and defense. We'd be looking at batting
  average or runs instead of two different statistical universes for
  people who are just changing sides.</p>
<p>DEFENSIVE STATS<br>
  ---------------</p>
<p>There are no good defensive stats for fans to use. We can count errors,
  fielding percentages, etc. They would probably make the bad guys look
  bad and the good guys look good, too. My belief is that if Benji Gil
  gets to two balls a game that Elster doesn't get to, and if he kicks one
  ball a game that Elster wouldn't kick, that puts us 162 outs ahead, not
  162 errors behind. There's more to it, errors demoralize pitchers and
  sometimes pressure the other players like Palmer to try too hard and<br>
  they throw the ball away. In general, the difference in range and
  consistency aren't measured well enough to make meaningful statistical
  comparisons between defensive performers.</p>
<p>Park factors make a difference here, too. If you play on grass vs turf,
  the inventory of skills you need to be good isn't the same. If you play
  left field in Fenway, it's not like left field in tBiA.</p>
<p>SUMMARY<br>
  -------</p>
<p>Baseball is a numbers game. The best teams win 3 out of 5, and the
  worst teams win 2 out of 5. That means that the difference in the best
  and worst teams is what they do one day a week (in a regular work
  week). The difference in the average teams and the great teams is what
  they do one day every two weeks. In ten games, so many things can<br>
  happen that are difficult to measure, but influence the outcomes of
  games. Teams like the Rangers on this current 7-3 streak on the road
  break all of the rules. Sometimes things just go your way. I marvel
  that the Braves can win with the offense they've got, but their pitching
  is something to see, day in and day out. They must have good defense or
  those pitchers wouldn't be getting that much credit on ESPN.</p>
<p>Thanks again to GaryP for stimulating such a lively discussion, and for
  helping to bring a different perspective about the game to Rangers fans.</p>
<p>And shame on anybody who takes a baseballs fan's opinions about the game
  and suggests that they represent personal flaws. There will always be
  Cubs and Yankees fans around, if you really want to find someone with a
  mental disorder and criticize them.</p>
<p>Later, the doubleheader is already going....</p>
