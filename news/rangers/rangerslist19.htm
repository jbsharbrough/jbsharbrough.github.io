<p>Um, that was Billy Preston. Likely, he was referring to what Stevie Wonder
  saw.</p>
<p>Billy, by the way, put at least two extra years into the Beatles experiment.
  They were beyond Geritol in terms of energy and enthusiasm and Billy
  &quot;Ripkin&quot; Preston came along. He hustled, played, and made it fun enough 
  for
  them to make it around the track one more time before the wheels fell off.</p>
<p>The talk out here on the coast (and I can't wait to fly home today, these 70
  degree days are for wimps) is the Barry Bonds might not reach 50 homers. I'm
  astounded at his 100 walks already this year. What does it tell you if the
  other team puts on a &quot;giant shift&quot; for you and then doesn't give you
  anything to hit? Yesterday, Bonds grounded into a 4-6-3 DP, but it didn't
  look like any I ever saw before.</p>
<p>For those of you who haven't seen it, the Snakes and the Stones put the 3rd
  baseman where the shortstop usually goes, the shortstop where the second
  baseman usually goes, and the second baseman plays rover, in shallow right
  field. The outfielders stand on the warning track, next to ladders.</p>
<p>Bonds lines a base hit to right, or what would have been one with a normal
  defensive alignment. The &quot;rover&quot; picks it up on one hop, fires to 
  second
  (where the shortstop is making a turn that is very unusual for him) and the
  relay to first got Barry.</p>
<p>I don't know how it is with other clubs, but these clubs don't even pretend
  to let Bonds in the game. It's like when the two weakest players vote the
  best player off the weakest link - the weak teams just walk Bonds so they
  can gore Jeff Kent. Kent is having an absolutely Kapler season - the ball
  seldom leaves the infield.</p>
<p>I asked myself, what if this was ARod? What if we didn't have anyone else
  who could hit, and teams just made a joke out of him like they do with
  Bonds? How long before that sweet swing turns into something more like my
  golf swing? It's not easy to tell, but I think that Raffy isn't protecting
  Alex - Pudge and Ruben are. Imagine that both of them are gone next year,
  and that Raffy has a decline. We could be watching ARod 2002 every time that
  some team walks Barry Bonds.</p>
<p>If that happens, we'll be talking a lot next year about how ARod's walks
  just show that the other team doesn't get the basic idea of good
  sportsmanship. We'll boo when the other team gets to 3-0 on him. They'll
  walk him without fear of our disapproval. Then Gabe Kapler, batting 4th,
  will pop up and the inning will be over. Seriously, think about next year's
  lineup with Sierra and Pudge gone.</p>
<p>1. Catman<br>
  2. Young<br>
  3. ARod<br>
  4. Raffy<br>
  5. Kapler<br>
  6. Lamb<br>
  7. Greer<br>
  8. Ledee<br>
  9. Haselman</p>
<p>Will the Rangers become the Stars, hoping to win 2-1 most of the time?</p>
<p>While I'm picking on Kapler, what will it take to send Gabe to OKC where he
  can make some outs without being a black hole in the Rangers lineup? I admit
  that he's typically a much better player than Bo Porter, but right now Gabe
  is really hurting. I watched him when I was at the game on the 17th, and he:&nbsp;<br>
<br>
  o popped to first, didn't even reach the dirt;<br>
  o fouled out to first, this one was deeper, almost to the outfield grass,
  and foul;<br>
  o grounded out<br>
<br>
  I think that GaryC is hitting better these days. As much as I like Gabe, I'm
  not wanting to watch him suffer any more.</p>
