<p>It's hard to tell for sure who will be on the Rangers roster this season.
  Still, taking Jamey's 40+1 roster for a starting spot, I asked myself: Who
  will be better this year, who will be worse? In terms of statistics only:</p>
<p><b>WORSE</b></p>
<p>ARod - This is a great player, and a real leader at a demanding defensive
  position. I think he'll have a sub-normal year for him - hit 300, with 35
  homers. I think this year his stats will suffer while he tries to hold the
  team together. He hasn't had a season like his rookie year since ... his
  rookie year. Lots of players and fans would be happy with a season of .300
  and 35 homers, but ARod will take $252 million dollars worth of heat from
  the great unwashed.</p>
<p>Igor - I expect his BA and power to fall, but I still think he'll be a lot
  better than what we had in right last year.</p>
<p>Park - tBiA will raise his ERA by over a run, but he'll win a lot of games
  with this offense.</p>
<p>Catman - I don't see .330 this year.</p>
<p>Todd Van Poppel - comes back to earth in front of the home fans, compared to
  last year in Chicago. Still a good year, and solid.</p>
<p><br>
<b>
  BETTER</b><br>
  Rob Bell - His work in the off season will pay off, Acosta will help him
  focus.</p>
<p>Kenny Rogers - I think this will be a good year for Kenny. He alternates,
  and this year his number is up.</p>
<p>Rocker - a new motion, a new team, a new man. His work in PR will help him.</p>
<p>Pudge - more games, good average, good power. I expect an MVP type season
  for him.</p>
<p>Raffy - more average, less power. There's no reason for this man to hit
  .260.</p>
<p>Mark Petkovsek - I could be wrong about him, but I think he's got something
  to prove, that he's not just in it for the money. I expect a return to his
  all-star form.</p>
<p>Mike Lamb - I probably support the Lammer more than anyone else on this
  list. I think this is the year that he starts driving the ball and fields
  incrementally better. Of course, the way it looks today, he won't be in
  Arlington in April.</p>
<p>Carl Everett - After the surgery, I expect better defensive range and better
  offensive stats.</p>
<p>Rusty Greer - See Carl Everett. If Rusty stays healthy, he's a terrific DH
  for this team - high OBA, good guy to have around, and can hit the ball out
  to end the game.</p>
<p><b>SUMMARY</b></p>
<p>GaryC was so right - how do you lose 90 games with a $90 million payroll?
  Well, you have to work at it a little bit every day, and get a break here
  and there.</p>
