<p>Hello to the list. Come with me into the Twilight Zone. For
  your consideration ...</p>
<p>Some of you are less inclined to stat-worship than others. I'm
  taking a minute of your time to discuss home-road records because
  the Rangers play three in KC starting tomorrow, and looking atKC's record uncovers a unique situation.... they are 15-30 at
  home (last in the AL) and 28-24 on the road (4th in the AL).</p>
<p>Winning, Home and Road - AL 5 (including Texas), NL 3 (the
  division leaders). The best home records are the NYankees at
  33-6 and the Padres at 33-9. Everyone else has lost 16 or moreat home.</p>
<p>Winning at home, losing on the road - AL 3 (Toronto, GaryC's O's,
  and the M's), NL 7 (featuring the Dodgers, whose home and road
  records offset each other to make them a .500 club, and the Cardinals, mentioned below as the Missouri Mystery). None of
  these teams has an overall winning record.</p>
<p>Losing, Home and Road - AL 5, NL 4. The worst road teams are
  Seattle (17-30, and 8-28 on grass) in the AL and it's a tough
  call in the NL -- Arizona (16-35), Montreal (15-30) and Florida
  (13-30) are all welcome sights when they get off the bus.</p>
<p>Others - here's the guys who keep it from being simple. The
  Brewers are 25-25 at home and 23-23 on the road. They can't win
  anywhere, but they're close. That .500 record puts them ahead of St Louis and Pittsburgh, who are bigger losers on the road than
  winners at home, and the Weird Cincinnati Reds, who are losers at home and are even at 25-25 on the road. And then there's the
Royals ...</p>
<p>KC is 15-30 at home, losing two of three, and 28-24 on the road.
  That's a better road record than home and road winners Texas
  (24-21), and Boston (26-24). It makes one wonder what this homefield advantage is, after all.</p>
<p>Conventional wisdom says that home field advantage has two
  contributing factors. You're in your own house, bed, car,
  schedule, etc, which is supposed to be good for you. Then there
  is the tactical advantage of having the last bat. I consider
  this last a relatively small advantage, because baseball games
  are almost never lost in the last bats - it makes the news when
  someone blows a 9th inning lead.</p>
<p>But here you got two teams in Missouri, one is a home winner and
  a road loser for an overall losing record (the Cards) and the
  other is a home loser and a road winner for ... an overall
  losing record (the Royals). I think that they should all leave
  their wives and kids for the women that they stay with on the
  road. They might want to consider keeping the players in a hotel
  in Kansas City, and having them stay on the bus a little bit.</p>
<p>The Royals home record of 15-30 looks bad next to Tampa Bay at
  17-30. No place in ML Baseball is a more welcome sight for a
  visiting team than the clubhouse at KC, where the rest of the
  world is playing at a rate comparable to the Atlanta overall
  record (Atl is 663, 30-15 is 667).</p>
<p>I'm wondering if we could stay there and play them a few extra
  games.</p>
<p>A winning record on the road is pretty rare. In the NL, only the
  three division leaders have one, altho the Brewers and Reds are
  break even, at 9 and 13 games back, respectively. There are 6 in
  the AL, and the ones that aren't Royals are all first or second.
  Nobody wins on the road and loses at home, and loses overall. Nobody except the Royals, the Missouri Mystery.</p>
<p>The Yankees at +17, and the Braves at +10 are the only teams in
  baseball better than +7 on the road.</p>
<p>In other words, the Rangers are in a good spot to win the next 5
  games. Good thing they aren't playing the Royals here.</p>
