  Subject: Magic Numbers, revisited</font><br>
</p>
<p>Here's a post that I sent to the list in 1996 ...</p>
<p>As a biesbol fan, I am often asked by the unitiated - What's this magic number business? I have always replied, with an air of<br>
  mystery, that it's magic.</p>
<p>Since this is a Rangers list, we can speak openly about it. A
  magic
  number is the number of wins and losses needed to eliminate a
  single opponent. If, at the end of the season, your team has W
  wins and L losses, and you are tied with your opponent, the
  simplified standings would look like this:</p>
<pre>Team  Wins Losses Games Back
----- ---- ------ ----------
Us      W    L        ---
Them    W    L        ---</pre>
<p>In this situation, we are tied, and our wins plus their losses is
  ... W+L. Fine, right? Well, if we want to eliminate them, we need
  one
  more win or one less loss, right?</p>
<pre>Team  Wins Losses Games Back
----- ---- ------ ----------
Us      W   L       ---
Them    W-1 L       0.5
Other   W   L+1     0.5</pre>
<p>Let's restate that as:</p>
<pre>Team  Wins Losses Games Back
----- ---- ------ ----------
Us     UW    UL      ---
Them   TW    TL      0.5
Other  OW    OL      0.5</pre>
<p>Some of you are hearing footsteps right now. Sneaking up behind
  you is the realization that if UW+TL &gt; season length (SL), then
  they
  can't catch us. Why? because when you are tied, UW+TL=Season
  length. You gotta have an edge somewhere.</p>
<p>In the modern 162 game season (I think 144 is enough, but these
  guys are real marathoners), you can calculate Magic Number as
  162+1-UW-TL. When it's 0, you have won enough games and they
  have lost enough that they can't catch you.</p>
<p>It's interesting that there is a relationship, approximately,
  between
  having a certain lead on a certain date and your magic number.
  So,
  the conventional wisdom that 10 games on August 1 or 5 games
  on Sept 1 is enough is really restateable as a ratio of Magic
  number
  to games remaining. Not many teams fold up fast enough to lose
  when this ratio is in their favor, but last year's Angels did one
  of
  the biggest I've ever seen. An 11 game lead in mid august ...
  let's
  see, that's about 45 games to go, so they have played about 120
  games. UW-UL+TW-TL was about 22 (we're plus 20 and they're
  minus 2) 70-50 vs 60-60. Magic Number would be about 33, with
  40 games to play - a .75 ratio.</p>
<p>When it's 1, I think that you're OK. When it gets under .75, you have a big advantage. The rangers are at 29, with 35 games to
  go.</p>
<p>If the ratio gets under .75, you can go .500 the rest of the way,
  they
  have to play about .750 to catch you. You know, there's a math
  guy
  from Baylor on this list, .... Weaver ... I bet he knows more
  about
  this than I do.</p>
<p>At any rate, the soonest that the Rangers could clinch would be
  15
  days, assuming that they win and the other team(s) lost daily.
  Since
  even lousy teams win 2 out of 5, it's reasonable to assume thatSeattle will win at least 14 games, and 2-3 each week. They
  wouldlose, if most futile, 4 games a week. If the Rangers win 4 games
  a
  week, they would make up 8 magic numbers a week, and it would
  be 3-1/2 weeks until they clinch ... that looks like about Sept
  17 at
  the earliest. It's also a lousy projection because it's
  basically linear
  and nothing in baseball is linear.</p>
<p>For my own personal pick, I'll give the Pinealla factor some
  credit
  and choose Sept 21. And I've calculated something else, too.
  With
  the money I saved by not buying the 8 season tickets this year, I
  can afford the scalpers.</p>
<p>--- end of old post.</p>
<p>PS. GaryC and I got to go to the playoff game here that Elster
  did so badly in. I don't remember when they clinched, but I
  thought that they had more than a week. Does anyone know? And
  where are you, Charles Weaver? We miss you.</p>
<p>PPS. The Rangers have played some really fine baseball games the
  past three nights - the last Toronto game and the first two with
  the Bosox are real GEMS. And I think that two of them are 4-3
  deals!</p>
