<p>... or at least that's what it sounds like to me....</p>
<p>Hello to the list, and anyone who gets this note by mistake.</p>
<p>The recent scurry of little feet to jump off the Rangers'
  bandwagon over starting pitchers seems premature to me.</p>
<p>1. It's only May.<br>
  2 All three of the suspect starters have had a few good games.<br>
  3. We have a lot of pitching in OKC but it's not any better than
  what we've got here.</p>
<p>That Perisho kid we got for Hill gave up 5 runs in six innings
  last night. I don't think that he's going to handcuff the AL
  next week. I haven't seen anyone but Moody and Levine that I
  think can pitch up here. I'm tempted to give Al Levine the long
  relief job until Pavlik can take it back. Al went 4-2/3 last
  night, looked great. Less filling. Looked great. Less
  filling....</p>
<p>4. Helling hasn't looked so good since his 130 something outing.</p>
<p>During the 8 run whipping of a third inning last night, Oliver
  was making some very good pitches. Tatis missed two chances to
  end the inning, too. I'm not ready to abandon Tatis or Oliver.</p>
<p>5. We won 6 straight before losing these last two.<br>
  6. We're about to get to play somebody other than the Red Sox,
  Yankees, and Indians.<br>
  7. (GaryC, please skip this item) The Orioles have the biggest
  payroll in the history of the game and they're dead last in their
  division behind an expansion team. You think you got troubles?</p>
<p>I heard last night that the Orioles will back up the truck really
  soon, and start dumping stars like the Marlins did. That will
  create opportunities for the Rangers. I don't think that they'll
  take expensive Orioles players, and I don't think that the O's
  will part with any pitching. All the same, if you move Alomar
  and Raffy, it moves two other people somewhere else, and so it<br>
  goes....</p>
<p>8. Nobody is going to give us a good pitcher this year. That
  includes Oakland and Kenny Rogers. They have plenty of offense,
  they are hurting for pitching, and he's all they've got. It's
  fun to speculate about him coming back, but it won't be during
  this season.</p>
<p>Take heart, Rangers fans! We will probably lose 40 or 50 more
  games, and stink to high heaven for weeks at a time! Not only
  that, but some players will go into slumps for a month at a time.</p>
<p>Burkett has a way of pitching 7 perfect innings and then pitching
  7 perfectly lousy starts. He's too smart to fight that long,
  he'll come around. Oliver has some terrific stuff, and he's
  STILL young for a pitcher. We'd like to break even on their
  starts. Witt is the number 5 guy, he'll soak up innings, and if
  you go five under 500 for his starts, it's probably not bad. You
  might even go 10 under. We're going to be between 20 and 30 over
  on the starts for Helling and Sele, if the present trend
  continues. We'd end up with about 90 or 92 wins, and that should
  win the west. Two guys can get you all the way to the World
  Series Championship.</p>
<p>Important note:</p>
<p>I'm not suggesting that we end the discussion wherein we roast
  the guys who do the worst. It's a lot of fun and I'm all for
  piling on a guy when he's down since he'll never know about it.</p>
