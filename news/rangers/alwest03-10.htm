<h2>The 2003 AL West 10 Game Graph</h2>

<p>I'm fond of this graph, even if it's a little busy. There are three parts to 
it: Runs Scored, Wins, and Runs Allowed. The Runs Allowed are graphed as 
negative values, so the best numbers are the highest ones on the graph, just as 
with the Runs Scored. In between these sets of lines are dashed lines showing 
the number of wins in each 10 game span, and they are graphed on the right hand 
axis.</p>

<p>In an average 10 game span, a team would score 45 runs, yield 45 runs, and 
win 5 games. Last year the Angels scored 80 runs in a ten game span, this year 
the Rangers have done it once. As a rule, a variation of 20 runs from average is 
a pretty big one - meaning that 25-65 is the range that holds almost every 
total. Note that the A's are just not giving up many runs.</p>

<p>Oh, and the right-most measurement is not always complete. It includes only 7 
games for Anaheim, and 8 for the other teams, in this graph. Measuring any 
period less than 10 games is really not comparable to the others at all. You 
never know when Seattle will give up 13 runs in five games, and then give up 14 
in one.</p>

<p>Another thing that you can see is that Texas doesn't have the dominating 
offense that one would suspect. They've only led their division once in the 
first 40 games, and may lead in the 5th segment. It's also clear that Texas 
gives up a lot more runs, on the whole, than the other teams. They're working on 
that.</p>

<p>Comments:</p>

<p>50 games - The Rangers actually played big league ball for ten games. Their 
pitching was good enough to put them near Anaheim and Seattle in runs allowed, 
they led the division in runs scored for the second time in 5 10-game segments, 
and they won the most games for the first time. </p>
