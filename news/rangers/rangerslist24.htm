<p>Hello to the list,</p>
<p>I come today to praise Bill Haselman. Maybe the 200 innings he's caught this
  season are statistically a fluke. Maybe his hitting is a fluke. Still, the
  DaMN leads me to believe that he is having a big influence on young
  pitchers, and for some reason that I don't understand, the Rangers need it.</p>
<p>That's not an attempt at a joke. Here's what I mean. In the first inning,
  three Royals hitters pulled the ball down the left field line for a double.
  In each case, the fleet footed FrankCat was nowhere close to the ball. When
  I see an outfielder that far from a batted ball, I assume that the pitcher
  lacks command, missed the target by a foot.</p>
<p>I have a few other assumptions behind that. I assume that there were
  meetings before the game where it was agreed how the Rangers want to handle
  the hitters. I don't know why I assumed this, but I always thought that
  there was a coach present. I realize that is an assumption, I've never been
  to a pregame meeting. I also assume that someone communicates that to the
  infielders and outfielders. If we plan to pitch a guy away, we may not want
  to play him to pull, that kind of thing. I'm not suggesting that we want to
  tip the pitches by moving them around, but that we indicate a general
  expectation of where the ball will be batted and that this expectation is
  influenced by where the ball is pitched.</p>
<p>Having voiced those assumptions, you can see what went through my mind
  during the first inning. FrankCat was way off the line, but the ball was
  being hit right down it. That makes me think that Davis was missing, that
  the plan was to pitch those hitters away.</p>
<p>Enough preamble, you say, what about Haselman? Today's paper says that Davis
  was shelled in KC and in the first inning because he relied on a cut
  fastball on the fists to righties. They camped on it in KC and they came out
  camped on it last night. After the first inning, in the dugout, Haselman
  suggested to Davis that they go to the cutter away. Davis agreed, saying he
  just &quot;nods and hits the glove.&quot; The KC hitters never made the adjustment
  very well, and Davis only gave up three more singles.</p>
<p>So why praise Bill Haselman? Here's a guy who has ridden the pine since he
  got here, except when Pudge has been hurt. Somehow, he's managed to remain
  ready to play big-league ball, and ready to help. I don't wish any
  unhappiness to Pudge, and I want him somewhere on this Rangers team. But
  Bill here has a catcher's ERA of 4.41 (according to the USA today site, the
  team era for the season is 5.57, for 1253 innings) for just over 200
  innings, and is hitting 313 to boot. He says that playing every day is
  getting his timing back.</p>
<p>The team ERA with Haselman catching last year, according to the MLB site,
  was 4.95. I don't know what the Rangers team ERA was. I use it to suggest
  that things are different in Arlington today. On 1 May, we didn't see
  everyday production from Young, Lamb, Catalanotto, Sierra or Haselman. We
  didn't see Moreno, Kolb, Davis, Bell or Myette pitching.</p>
<p>I like what I see on the field these days, and I like what I hear about the
  way that Bill Haselman works with the young pitchers. I don't expect Bill to
  be a big part of the 2003 Ranger team, the one that contends for the World
  Series, but I think he is making a contribution today. He's showing our
  young pitchers that working with a catcher can make them better. I hope that
  the expectation of the players, coaches and manager is that catchers
  continue to do that here in Texas.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Schedule conflict?</b> Did you see that the Angels team doctor, Lewis Yoacum or
  some similar spelling, won't be at Pudge's knee operation because of a
  schedule conflict? I'm trying to imagine that phone conversation. &quot;How 
  about
  Tuesday?&quot; &quot;Busy.&quot; &quot;A week after that? This isn't life threatening.&quot; 
  &quot;Busy.&quot;
  &quot;Some other day before the 30th?&quot; &quot;Busy.&quot; There aren't many 
  other scenarios
  that would prevent this from happening. Do you think they would let the List
  Group assist?</p>
