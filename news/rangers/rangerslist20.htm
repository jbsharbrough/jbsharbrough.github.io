<p>It appears that we are assessing the geezer signings from a perspective of
  hindsight. I think that the underachievement of the veterans signed, based on
  a previously unexpected interleague transition problem, was not expected.
  The development of minor league infielders, and the dissolution of the major
  league outfield, were also not expected. I won't go into the pitching, but
  we all thought it it would be bad, just not as bad as it was in the first
  ten weeks of the season.</p>
<p>Based on last year's performance, Lamb was clearly not ready to play for a
  contending team this year. I didn't hear anyone, before the season started,
  saying that Micheal Young was ready to be an everyday big league ballplayer.
  Signing veterans to one and two year deals made a lot of sense last winter.
  I can't say why Galarraga was signed, unless they thought he could DH every
  day. They were seen as stopgap signings to bridge us to the point where the
  young players were ready to step in. They were expected to provide some
  leadership in the clubhouse as well. Hey guys, isn't that exactly what
  happened? Just that in Micheal Young's case, it was six weeks instead of a
  year and a half? And Lamb is clearly improved enough to play here, more
  about him later. We didn't know what to do with Catalanotto, either.</p>
<p>We had five outfielders last winter: Greer, Kaplar, Mateo, Ledee, and I
  forget. I really thought that Mateo would be a big league star by now. I
  thought that Kapler had turned the corner and would hit too. We all figured
  that either Greer or Ledee would be surplus, and be traded for pitching.
  Okay, Mateo was traded for Bell. Our outfield is not very good, but based on<br>
  what we knew in March, it was going to be an area where we wouldn't have to
  worry.</p>
<p>I expected Caminiti and Galarraga to hit, too. A lot. I thought it would be
  a regular lumber company. Instead of being big hitters, they were just big.
  I never suspected that hitters who were (and are) so successful in the NL
  would have trouble in the AL. It's a transplant that didn't take. If those
  two had hit here like they've hit since they left, teams would have given us
  value for them. From this vantage point, the money is called wasted. From
  the vantage point of the winter, I don't think that we expected them to
  underachieve so much. They did, and we lost the chips we bet on them. That's
  life in the casino, guys.</p>
<p>Player moves are gambling. The great thing about this game is that you never
  know what's going to happen once the season starts. The Yankees win without
  a roster full of superstars. The Rangers and Orioles and Rockies spend a lot
  and lose like crazy. The Mariners part with three great players and then run
  off and hide from the league. I don't think that management can do something
  to change the conditions enough that there is no gambling involved.</p>
<p>It's clear to me that teams come up with a Plan A in the winter, but they
  have to work on Plan B, C, and so on for the regular season. When Caminiti
  and Big Cat underachieve, and we have players that can do better, we get
  what we can for them. Plan A was for them to succeed, Plan B was to trade
  them for value, and we got ... Plan C. Plan A was for Mateo to be a star.
  Plan B was for him to catch fire in OKC. We got ... Plan C. He's not even a
  Louisville slugger.</p>
<p>Going the other way, Plan A was to play Velarde and Catman at second while
  Young and Romano slugged it out in the minors. Plan B was to trade one of
  the good ones for something else we need. Plan C appears to be to look at
  Romano in center and leave Young at 2nd.</p>
<p>These are a few examples of the way that the management of this team has
  adjusted during the seasoon, balancing the short term and the long term. I
  like what I see. I can't fault them for the risks they took - as I've said
  already this week, I think that the money was spent to convince ARod that
  they were serious. It's not all wasted in my view - they've dealt with each
  situation in a way that I think shows that they're going in the right
  direction.</p>
<p>I better get to work.</p>

  &gt; &gt;All of these are very true. All of the silly deals for geezers have 
  set<br>
  &gt; &gt;this team back two years already, in addition to costing the team more<br>
  than<br>
  &gt; &gt;half of the Greer contract price that you gripe about so much.<br>
  &gt; &gt;<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; Explain exactly who was set back and how this team was set back two years.<br>
  &gt; I just don't see it. Since the players involved are gone after half a<br>
  &gt; year, it is not immediately apparent how this team was set back 2 years.</p>
<p>Well, the improvement we have seen in July probably starts in May, so the
  team might have been a wild card contendor this year, instead of now
  looking to 2003. Looking at the player development side instead of the
  competition side, they lost a good cheap hitter in Valdes, lost PA given to
Velarde/Caminiti that could have gone to Lamb/Young/Romano to speed their<br>
  development, lost PA given to Galarraga that could have gone to Valdes,
  lost innings given to Petkovsek that could have gone to any number of guys
  for development purposes.</p>
<p>Add in the $14.45M (now really around $13.3M due to losing a small portion
  of Galarraga's salary) wasted, without which you could have paid for around
  2/3 of the Greer mistake, making it not a big deal instead of a real
  problem (he is probably only going to be worth $12M over the next three
  years in reality).</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, the moves were an unmitigated disaster. When&nbsp;
you have the number 7 payroll and the number 21 team and not likely to
  contend even if you retain the number 7 payroill next year, the year is a
  complete loss that is carrying over.</p>
