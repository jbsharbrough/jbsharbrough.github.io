<p>Hello to the list,</p>
<p>Since I shot my mouth off about Levine being a better pitcher
  than Burkett, I took comfort in this part of last night's box<br>
  score:</p>
<pre>          IP H R R W K #P ERA
Burkett  2/3 5 4 4 2 0 18 6.09
Levine 3-2/3 4 1 1 1 4 53 4.18</pre>
<p>Next time I'll probably get killed. I'll add that the Rangers are
  9-20 in Burkett's starts this year. That would be the worst team
  winning percentage in the American League, were it the team
  result. Put another way, the Rangers are 62-45 in games not
  started by Burkett, and that includes the time that Witt, Oliver,
  and any other stiff you want to throw in was out there. I'm in favor of banning players with ERAs over 6.00 who have thrown over
100 innings from further play this season. If I lower that
  innings requirement to 30, we'll lose Stottlemyre (6.53), too.</p>
<pre>Boy, it hurt when Patterson got shelled last night, didn't it? Does anyone think that the fastball and changeup were moving in the bullpen when he warmed up?
