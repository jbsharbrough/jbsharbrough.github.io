<p>Hello to the list!</p>
<p>Thanks, GaryP and GJ, for a look at the many possible futures for
  Rangers fans. Thinking about it led me to a number of almost
  related thoughts...</p>
<p>* Geez those guys don't walk much.<br>
  * Is there any statistic that shows an area of general
  improvement in Texas minor leaguers during the Melvin/Oates era?<br>
  * What is the correlation between the kind of &quot;program&quot; that they
  claim to want to build, and the one that they are building?<br>
  * Is there any reason to believe that they are on the road to
  contention?</p>
<p>I've only taken a cursory look at the statistics, but my
  impression is that this group still doesn't make pitchers, and
  makes hitters that lack plate discipline. Let a guy come along
  who doesn't fit that description, and some other flaw will lead
  them to get off him, and he won't blossom here. I'm still
  waiting for Tatis to hit.</p>
<p>It seems like this group managed to sign some spectacular players
  (Gonzalez, Rodriguez) and a few good ones (Palmer, Helling) and
  correct me if I'm wrong, but all that was before the crew we've
  got now. I know that you have to give a new coach a chance to
  recruit and develop his own players, but I can't believe that there weren't any major leaguers in our system besides Patterson
  when those guys got here.</p>
<p>I still don't know how Al Levine gets so many people out. I
  wonder what the papers would be saying about him if he was
  Jonathan Johnson. I think that his play is better than his
  reputation, that he's undervalued.</p>
<p>I wonder if it isn't like that old first division-second division
  thing in the 50s: The KC A's develop all the players for the
  good teams, and trade them for more prospects that they can
  develop into good players, and on and on. It looks to me like
  the Twins, Pirates and Expos do a really good job bringing up
  ballplayers, and I would probably add the A's to that list.</p>
<p>With the financial muscle that Hicks brings, maybe the strategy
  is to draft players with tools, and trade them to good
  development programs for expensive major leaguers. I don't see
  bright prospects for this program outside of that.&nbsp;</p>
<p> On the other hand, if someone could show me that the kids we
  draft do better in on base percentage every year, that they get
  better defensively every year, and that they throw strikes better, I'll just shut up and wait for the oven buzzer to go off.</p>
<pre>Happy New Year, everyone
