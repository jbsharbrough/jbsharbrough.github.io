<h1>Hey, an 8 game winning streak ....</h1>
<p>... that's not so bad.</p>
<p>And they lost the 2 games before it, and the one after it, by a single run
given up in the 9th. Poor Johnny Rock. That boy has to be on the worst emotional
roller coaster you can have without losing a family member.</p>
<p>Juando took a lame swing on 3-1 with the game on the line last night. I'm
waiting for him to get into a groove.</p>
<pre>YEAR   OPS SLG
Career 345 564
2001   370 590
2002   335 438</pre>
<p>I think that his hands still hurt. A night or two ago, he made a wild throw
to the plate - and the hitter moved up to second. Juan looks like he wants to
win and like he's pressing to try to contribute. I think that if they would
switch to the red uniforms, he would be okay and they would win more games.</p>
<p>I've decided that the four things affecting this team's performance are
mental outlook, durability, talent, and coaching. I think that GaryC is right
about the manager's shortcomings when handling pitchers. Let's dissect the
bullpen another day. Today I'd like to suggest that durability has hurt this
team more than most other teams.</p>
<p>My basic evidence is based on plate appearances. Of course the best players
have more plate appearances than the other players, and it is my belief that
availability of the six or eight best players has a relation to offense. You
could probably do the same thing with innings and defense - and combine the two
for victories. What I really want to do is find a way to measure who is missing
their best players, and for that I stick with the simple plate appearance.</p>
<p>It's calculated as the sum of at-bats, walks, hit by pitch, and sacrifice
hits (AB+BB+HBP+SH). The MLB site shows the stat as TPA. For Texas, the top 10
players in plate appearances are:</p>
<pre>Player   TPA Note
-------- --- -----------------------------
Arod     345 There every day
Raffy    298 Should have played less
M Young  270 Played behind Catalonotto
Rusty    218 Injured, 17 RBI
Perry    203 Played behind Blalock
Gabe     189 Platoons and injury
Lamb     178 Minors, platoons, defensive risk
Juando   176 Injury, 18 RBI
Everett  158 Injury, 18 RBI
Haselman 157 Plays behind Pudge</pre>
<p>It looks like several of the Rangers best players aren't even on this list.
Pudge will pass Haselman within a week. Heck, who IS this team's center fielder?</p>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<p>300+ TPA - 1 player<br>
250+ TPA - 2 players<br>
200+ TPA - 2 players</p>
<p>Let's compare that to the rest of the AL West</p>
<pre>    200 250 300 TOT RUNS
Tex  2   2   1   5   379
Sea  1   3   4   8   405
Ana  3   1   5   9   418
Oak  2   2   2   6   382</pre>
<p>I would agree that having a dependable lineup isn't the same thing as having
a good lineup. You can run some tomato cans and antenna balls out there every
day and get a lot of plate appearances[1]. This table seems to indicate that
there is a correlation between having a stable lineup and scoring runs in the AL
West.</p>
<p>My point is that Juan Gonzalez is 25 PA away from 200, and that 9 Angels are
already past that. Several of these players are in the equivalent of the latter
half of May, and the rest of the league is a month ahead of them.</p>
<p>It is not quite as simple to decide what to do about it. If you managed the
Rangers, which players would you send out there every day?</p>
<p>RF Juando<br>
CF Lutwick, Everett<br>
LF Mench, Greer, Everett, Catalanotto<br>
3B Perry, Blalock<br>
SS ARod<br>
2B Young, Catalanotto<br>
1B Palmeiro<br>
C Pudge<br>
DH Lamb, Greer, Kapler, Catalanotto</p>
<p>Everything is related to everything. That truism is painfully obvious when
one realizes that durability, talent, coaching, and mental outlook are all
related to the team's performance, and that you can't change one without having
some impact on the others. The Rangers have struggled for all of those reasons
this season, and stopping the bleeding won't be as simple as filling out the
lineup card with your nine best hitters. But wouldn't that be an easy first
step?</p>
<p>Maybe some other time I'll take a look at the bullpen and starting pitching -
it wouldn't surprise me to see the team with the least injuries win because I
hear that it happens every year.</p>

<p>[1] Maybe not. A tomato can and an antenna ball will probably tend to walk a
lot.
