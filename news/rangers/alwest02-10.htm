<h1>2002 American League West 10-game numbers</h1>
<p>I lost interest after about 90 games. I didn't enter the stats for the other 
teams any more.<p><img border="0" src="../images/alw02-10.jpg" width="911" height="623">

<p>This graph shows, at a glance, the number of runs scored by AL West teams in
a ten game period. It also shows the number of victories that each had during
that period. The runs are read from the scale on the left, the victories from
the scale on the right. Runs allowed are negative - so a low graph is bad and a
less low graph is good.<p>The 10 game periods are arbitrary. A team might get
really cold for the first 5 games and really hot for the next five. It's just a
kind of thermometer for seeing who is streaky and who is consistent. I don't
distinguish between home and road games, or any other part - so Seattle could
win 8 of 10 on the road and Oakland could win 7 of 10 at home and it would look
like they were performing comparably when they're not. Hey, they go out every
day and do what they can, right?<p>16JUN - You can see that the Rangers pitching
fell off the table in games 41-50 and stayed there in games 51-60. They gave up
67 runs in each 10 game period. It's surprising that they won 5 of those 20
games. The offenses kind of bunched up during games 51-60. Seattle is not
scoring runs - they'll be glad to get Edgar back but he can't get them from last
to first in runs in this division - they are just not scoring like last year.
Meanwhile, the Angels are scoring runs and they're not giving up runs and
they're doing it consistently - they will be in it as long as they can keep
their players on the field.<p>&nbsp;</body></html>
