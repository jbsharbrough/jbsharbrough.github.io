<p>Here are a few semi-unrelated news notes. Check out the batting
  average of Todd Zeile. Look at Clayton's too while you're at
  it. Where's Mario Mendoza when you need him?</p>

<p>Ouch. It IS ten percent of the season. If Clayton hits .300
  for the next 50 games, he'll get to .250.</p>

  TATIS TATTOES TATERS LIKE TOPSY</b></p>
<p> (AP) - A St. Louis Cardinals player made major league
  homer
  history Friday night, with Mark McGwire merely a<br>
  footnote.
  Fernando Tatis hit two grand slams in one inning as the
  Cardinals
  beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 12-5.</p>
<p>... that trade is looking better since we re-signed Clayton.</p>

<p>Doug Rader said it about LaRussa's White Sox when Rader managed
  our Rangers. It looks like they'll have trouble getting up a
  team to win the West this year. Then again, the Rangers have
  opened the season with a slumping 3-4 homestand, followed by a
  6-4 road trip to Seattle, Oakland, New York, and Minnesota.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  That's gutsy, I'll stay tuned.</p>

<p><b>CUTTING OUT THE DEADWOOD</b></p>
<p> (AP) - A lot of people who have been getting season tickets to
  Michigan football games will never get to use them. They're<br>
  dead.</p>
<p> 
  The university ran a check on some of the 23,000 season ticket
  holders and found 275 were listed as deceased by Social<br>
  Security.
  Letters were sent to their addresses to verify the deaths and
  to
  learn if there was a surviving spouse who would remain entitled to the tickets, The Detroit News said. Descendants are
  ineligible
  to inherit the tickets. Seventeen of those listed as deceased
  turned out to be alive. &quot;There was one little bug, I guess you
  could call it, in the system,&quot; said ticket manager Martin Bodnar.
  &quot;I deeply regret this.&quot;</p>
<p> Bodnar said 22 calls in response to the letter were from
  &quot;widows
  who had not notified us their husbands had passed away. I told
  them we would transfer the tickets into their name.&quot; Other
  calls,
  he said, were from children &quot;who had been using their deceased
  parents' tickets for years. I explained to them our firm policy that after parents pass away, their season tickets are not to
  be
  transferred to their children or anyone else.&quot; Michigan has
  over
  9,000 people on a waiting list for season tickets.</p>
<p>Looks like 236 down, 8,764 to go.</p>
