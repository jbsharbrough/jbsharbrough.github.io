<h1>2002 American League West Pennant Race</h1>
<p>Late in the season, with the Rangers out of it in the west, I started 
checking to see how they were doing against other teams. Until that pratfall at 
the end, they were running right in the middle of the league.<p>

<p>I'm sorry to say that I don't update this graph like I would if the Rangers
hadn't already trashed the season. Still, a baseball season tells the story of
humanity: men under pressure - traveling, competing in a very public setting
against the best in the world, looking inside themselves and hoping they find
something there.&nbsp;<p>16JUN - I'm as impressed with the turnarounds that the
Angels and Athletics have made as I'm unimpressed with the turnaround that Texas
has made in the other direction. This page, and the 10 game graph that
accompanies it, tell me a lot about what's going on from the 30,000 foot level.
I love business-speak.
