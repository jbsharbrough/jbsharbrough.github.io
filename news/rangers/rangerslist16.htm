<p>Doug Melvin looks to me like a really good guy in his first GM job. He's
  getting to try things that he always wanted to try - like stressing pitching
  and defense and building up a minor league program.</p>
<p>He also looks like he's doing what many executives do - choosing what he
  wants to worry about. It appears that he's happy dealing with player
  personnel and player development issues, and that he's not interested in
  breaking in managers. It's clear that he held onto Johnny Oates after Oates
  ceased to be an asset and crossed over into the realm of liabilities. It
  appears that Hicks understood that and intervened this time.</p>
<p>Often, after you deal with the thing you've avoided, you learn not to fear
  it and you don't have the problem anymore. I think that manager was an
  intentional blind spot for Melvin, but now that he's been through it I think
  he'll be a better GM for it.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - I don't think that Doug's perfect. I still think that
  he gave away Canseco and Deano - but I think that he learned from those
  experiences (it appeared to me that Oates has stopped learning from his
  experiences). I'm very interested in seeing what kind of a GM that Doug
  Melvin will become as he grows in this job. I feel like the Rangers will win
  the World Series if they stick with him long enough.</p>
<p>I think that he knows pitching - I think that Johnny has been asking for all
  of this finesse instead of power, and that it's at least possible that
  Melvin appreciates a power pitcher. He did pursue Big Unit and Rocket, after
  all.</p>
<p>I guess I'm saying that I feel like we're not even to the middle of the Doug
  Melvin Book, and I'm wanting to stay in and read the whole thing.</p>
<p>Just my two cents.</p>

  Beau Sharbrough grounded out:</p>
<p>&gt; ... Grounds to Fire Johnny #1: not knowing what was going on.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; ... Instead, he chose to publicly say that no coach would leave unless he left first. This bad
judgment would be Grounds to Fire Johnny #2.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; ... IMHO, this rendered him completely untrustworthy forever more, and would be Grounds to Fire Johnny #3.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; ... What relationship had grown between these two that Pudge would think that JO was questioning his toughness? This would be Grounds to Fire Johnny #4.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; ... Playing it safe doesn't sell in this heat, and would be Grounds to Fire Johnny #5.<br>
  &gt;<br>
  &gt; ... That would be Grounds to Fire Johnny #6: he's one of the few managers who can misuse his starters and his bullpen so badly.</p>
<p>You made a lot of excellent points, Beau. And all those grounds to fire Johnny are Grounds to Fire Doug #1. Doug Melvin ignored these
  facts and put his friendship with Oates ahead of the team. Oates
  wanted to quit at the end of last season, but Melvin persuaded
  him to stay. On what grounds, I wonder? Grounds to Fire Doug #2!</p>
<p>&gt; There's a lot of talk about pitchers down here, but I don't&nbsp; think that JO works with kids well - he prefers the mid 30's former&nbsp;
Orioles. We've sent about a half a dozen pitchers who floundered&nbsp; here to other teams and seen them blossom - Rick Helling (Florida&nbsp;
Marlins), Robb Nen (Marlins and Giants), Esteban Loiaza (Cleveland),&nbsp; and so on. We offered Aaron Sele $28 million for 4 years and he&nbsp;
walked. We couldn't get Todd Stottlemyre to stay. We couldn't get&nbsp; Randy Johnson, Mike Mussina, or Mike Hampton to take us seriously.</p>
<p>Or especially Roger Clemens. This could be Grounds to Fire Doug #3.
  Pitchers fail here but blossom elsewhere and Doug apparently has no
  idea why. Free agent pitchers don't want to come here, even if money
  talks. Melvin apparently has no idea why.</p>
<p>&gt; I should admit that I stopped supporting Bobby Valentine about a year
  before&nbsp; he left, too. I mean, in the interest of full disclosure, I give up on&nbsp;
people and stay gave up on them forever, unless it's my second ex-wife.</p>
