</font>
<p>You might be familiar with PC operating systems such as WIndows, Mac OS, and
Linux. PDA's have several operating systems, too. The most common are the Palm
OS (from Palm), and PocketPC (from Microsoft, the old Windows CE).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The operating system is a set of programs that communicates between the
physical machine and the application software. You might imagine it as a layer:
the middle of a sandwich where the machine is the bottom piece of bread and
the application program is the top piece.</p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p>Pixel</p>
</font>
<p>Picture Element. One dot on a screen. Computers write to video memory in
basically the same way, whether the screen is monochrome or color. Generally, if
you have 65,000 colors, it means that you have 16-bit pixels, because 2 raised
to the 16<sup>th</sup> power is 65556 or so. In that kind of a color scheme,
there are 4 bits each for red, blue, and green, often displayed in
&quot;hexadecimal&quot; or base 16, which goes from 0 to F. Black is FFF, white
is 000. Since a 16-bit pixel takes 4 times as much information to render as a
4-bit pixel, some PCs encounter a bottleneck at the video adapter. You
&quot;pay&quot; for that extra data to be transported every time you draw a
screen. If you don't need lots of colors, and your computer runs slowly, think
about using less colors. Or buying a bigger Video card!</p>

<p>Thin Film Transistor. Sandwiched between glass and clear layers, there is a
transistor for each pixel of the display. This is also referred to as
&quot;Active Matrix&quot; display, because the display can be updated faster
than a passive matrix. For example, as a mouse is dragged across a passive
matrix LCD display, it disappears momentarily. The current required to update an
active matrix display is much less, and the response appears to be
instantaneous.</p>

<p>Reflective Thin Film Transistor. First developed for PDA by Compaq in March
1999.</p>
<p>In March of 1999, Compaq announced the first PDA with an RTFT screen.</p>
<p>&quot;Available with 8- or 16-megabytes (MB) of memory, the Compaq Aero 2100
product's crisp, clear color display uses reflective technology, which reflects
light from available sources off the back of the display to show information on
the screen, making the unit as easy to read outdoors as it is indoors.&quot;</p>

<p>Original Palm PDAs had a 160x160 pixel display. Current products feature
240x320 and they look more like the form factor of a pc screen, and have sharper
pictures. The Clie N760C has a 320x320 display. This is like having 4 original
palm screens to work with, dot-wise.</p>

<p>Displays were originally monochrome. There are still 16 gray (4-bit)
monochrome devices for sale. The color devices are 16-bit pixels, offering
65,000 colors. VGA is back!</p>

<p><a name="expansionslots">Expansion Slots</a> - types</p>
</font></i></b><font FACE="Arial">
<p>Springboard</p>
</font>
<p>Springboard slots are unique to Visor PDAs, such as the Handspring. They were
the original PDA expansion slots, and started the wave that became CF and SD.</p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p>CompactFlash™</p>
</font><p>CompactFlash™ (CF™) cards are small, removable mass storage devices. CF
cards are an industry standard format that can be Type I or II. Type II is 5mm
thick, Type 1 is 3.3mm thick. Type I cards work in all slots, Type II requires a
Type II compatible slot, due to its width. CF cards are
the size of a matchbook and weigh approximately one-half ounce. Available CF
cards range from 8MB of RAM to the 1GB IBM MicroDrive. The Microdrive needs a
Type II slot. The Microdrive is pictured below. Warning - these devices draw
battery power, and some run hot.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="images/uscoinmicrodrive.jpg" width="161" height="151"></p>
<p>CompactFlash cards are designed with flash technology, a non-volatile storage
solution that does not require a battery to retain data indefinitely. CF storage
products are solid state, meaning they contain no moving parts, and offer much
greater data protection than conventional magnetic disk drives.</p>
<p>The expansion card slot will also accept I/O devices based on the industry
standard CF format such as wireless modems, modems, Ethernet, serial, digital
phone cards, laser scanners, Bluetooth wireless, etc.</p>
<p>For more information about the CompactFlash standard, contact the <a HREF="http://www.compactflash.org/t_blank">CompactFlash
Association</a>.</p>
<font FACE="Arial">
<p>Secure Digital</p>
</font>
<p>Secure Digital (SD) memory cards are next generation memory devices that
offer an incredible combination of high storage capacity, currently 16, 32, and
64MB, and data security. SD cards are the size of a postage stamp, 32mm X 24mm,
and a mere 2.1mm thick. One SD slot can generally be used for either Secure
Digital or MMC cards.</p>
<p>SD cards are non-volatile, solid-state, and require no battery power to
operate. SD cards feature unique, proprietary security functions that have been
incorporated into the card’s controller, facilitating the secure distribution
of content to devices. In addition, the card features a physical protection tab
on its outer edge, providing users with an easy way to ensure their data is
write-protected. The expansion card slot will also accept I/O devices, including
those that use the new Bluetooth protocol.</p>
<p>For more information about the Secure Digital standard contact the <a HREF="http://www.sdcard.org/t_blank">SD
Card Association</a>. <font SIZE="3">Secure Digital expansion is an open standard being developed by the SD
association. Members include Sandisk, Olympus, Toshiba, Qualcomm,
Hewlett Packard, and Phillips Electronics.</p>
</font><font FACE="Arial">
<p>MultiMediaCard</p>
</font>
<p>MultiMediaCard (MMC) is an industry standard high storage capacity device the
size of postage stamp, weighing less than two grams. Maximum size of available
MMC devices is 64MB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like CF cards, MMC cards are non-volatile, solid-state and require no battery
power to operate.</p>

Association</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Memory">Memory</a> - ROM</p>
</font></i></b>
<p>ROM stands for Read Only Memory. The information in this memory is generally
&quot;burned&quot; into the chip one time, at the factory. Often in the PDA
world, it holds the operating system - Palm OS, Windows CE, Pocket PC 2002 and
so on. ROM memory is fast to start up and fast to load, and more
&quot;durable&quot; (less prone to corruption) than RAM.</p>
<b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p>Memory - RAM</p>
</font></i></b>
<p>RAM stands for Random Access Memory. This generally refers to memory that is
like a tablet and an eraser - you can write anything you want on it and re-use
it many times. Generally, RAM is &quot;volatile,&quot; meaning that when the
electricity is turned off, the memory is erased. Some electronics devices have
&quot;non-volatile&quot; RAM and recover their contents when turned off and back
on.</p>
<p>The original PCs had 256K bytes of memory. Now many of them have a gigabyte
available. The original Palm Pilots had 2MB of RAM. The models available today
have either 8MB or 32MB, but some are upgradable to 128MB.</p>
<b><i><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4">
<p>Memory - Flashable ROM</p>
</font></i></b>
<p>Flashable ROM is ROM that can be &quot;re-burned&quot; or
&quot;flashed.&quot; This is a form of investment protection - the operating
system can be updated without having to buy a new PDA, or having to remove and
replace the ROM chips.</p>
<p>A word of caution - A flashable ROM means that you can completely change the
application layer, flash a new ROM for the OS, and use the same machine. That
can be useful sometimes, but PDA manufacturers really don't know what kind of
upgrades to the OS will be needed in four years. There is no special reason to
believe that the hardware can easily be pressed into radically different uses
than those it has at manufacture. Still, Palm has upgraded the Palm OS a number
of times, and it can represent a method for delaying obsolescence.</p>
