<h2><b>Michael's Stores, EDI Followup, 2002.</b> </h2>
<p>Electronic Data Interchange, EDI, is a method of exchanging documents between
computer systems. Michaels uses this method with some of their vendors. The EDI
project manager at the Accounts Payable Center (APC) asked me to help organize
information about which vendor invoices were being received, and which were
being rejected, and why. The resulting MS Access application took Excel files as
input, updated an Access database, and sent emails to the EDI vendors
summarizing each day's activity.</p>
<p>Statistical summaries were then produced that identified the reject rates and
types, so that APC staff could work effectively with vendors to reduce rejects.</p>
<p><b>Biggest business challenge</b>: this was a simple project from a business
standpoint. Once the vendors began to receive emails, they contacted the EDI
staff with questions. The increased activity level required an adjustment period
for them. Beyond that hiccup, some vendors wondered why they were receiving the
information, or what the information meant. In each case, the final result was
better communication with vendors, and better followup by the APC.</p>
<p><b>Biggest technical challenge</b>: well, the email routine was a good coding
project. It included detail information for each vendor about that day's
production. It was also interesting to make written reports with fixed formats
for a varying number of error types - I eventually made a &quot;Top 5&quot;
format that featured six columns of data - the five most used reject rates for
the period being summarized, and a sixth column of &quot;Other&quot; that
included the rest of the work. There was another technical challenge to make
each process restartable - that required a number of tables that contained flags
which could be cleared in order to regenerate any missing stats..</p>
