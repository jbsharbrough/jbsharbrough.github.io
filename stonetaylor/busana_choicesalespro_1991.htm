<h2><b>Choice Homes, Sales*Pro, 1991</b>. </h2>
<p>For both the collections program at GraCom and Sales*Pro, I used a coding tool 
  called &quot;Stage.&quot; It was a primitive CASE tool where the developer designed 
  the tables, and Stage designed the data entry forms. This produced high quality 
  Clipper code, which we compiled and linked easily. Sales*Pro was an application 
  to track the lead slips coming into the VP Marketing's office from the field. 
  The VP Marketing defined a series of steps in the sales cycle, and I created 
  a database to model it. Then I used the Stage development tool to make his application.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenge</b>: gathering the data from the remote 
  communities. I created DOS batch files to copy the data on to 5-1/4&quot; floppy 
  disks and other batch files for the VP Marketing to import them into a central 
  file for reporting.</p>
