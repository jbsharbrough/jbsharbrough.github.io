<h2><b>GENTECH 2002, e-Newsletter, 2001.</b> </h2>
<p>The Conference Chair for the 2002 GENTECH conference wanted to use an
e-Newsletter to distribute information about the conference plans, the
conference program, the Boston area, and other related information. The
information would go to potential registrants and any other interested parties.
As of November 2002, the archive can still be found at <a href="http://www.gentech.org/gt02news/">http://www.gentech.org/gt02news/</a>.</p>
<p><b>Biggest business challenge</b>: anytime you edit something that requires
input from volunteers, things can lag behind the schedule. To address that
concern, we posted the publication schedule in advance. Any copy received after
the closing date for a given publication would automatically roll to a future
issue. It was also difficult to find a service provider - ListBot had gone away.
We settled on Microsoft bCentral. The service performed very well - surveys and
statistics were very helpful, and the mail seemed to run on time.</p>
<p><b>Biggest technical challenge</b>: the most difficult thing was the actual
production of each issue. It was our desire to make the newsletters look as good
as we could for those who received the HTML subscription. The method of
production was to create a web page, put it on the GENTECH site, then create a
text version for those subscribers who had opted not to receive it in HTML
format. It seems that about half of the time was spent on the collection and
preparation of graphics for each issue. A picture IS worth 1000 words.</p>
<p><b>Buzzwords</b>: electronic newsletter, Photoshop, web page design.</p>
