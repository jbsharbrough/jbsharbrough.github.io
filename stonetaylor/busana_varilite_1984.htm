<h2><b>VARI*LITE, 1984</b></h2>
<p>Vari*Lite (VL) manufactures computer controlled lighting. In 1984, they bought 
  a System 38 and wanted a customized closed loop Material Requirements Planning 
  system created. VL was not a large firm at the time, and working with one staff 
  programmer, we developed a set of applications we named JIP for Jobcost, Inventory, 
  and Purchasing. The CFO, Richard Rader, credited the information in it with 
  helping the company avoid an early demise by avoiding an excess of raw material 
  inventory. They used the application for ten years.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting business challenge</b>: getting consensus. Building something 
  that worked at VL was not easy. The business was founded renting sound systems 
  for the touring entertainment industry. Most of the managers were former touring 
  sound mixers, and there was not a large pool of managers with business experience 
  to gather requirements from. The requirements changed regularly. Meetings were 
  held to storyboard the details of entering a capital asset, for example, and 
  managers who would never use the program offered their insight. It made the 
  final product better, because they had a passing knowledge of what information 
  was in the system and what work was required to manipulate it. We also held 
  big picture meetings and progress review meetings so that people understood 
  where we were and where we were going. Priorities were set by consensus between 
  the CFO and me.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenges</b>: create a bill of material and 
  routing with an indefinite number of levels. We dealt with it as parent/child 
  binary pairs, and only created the exploded bill of material at run time, by 
  having the user specify a starting point, and then following all of the components 
  until there were no more.</p>
