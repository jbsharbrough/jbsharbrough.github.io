<h2><b>GraCom Services, 1990.</b> </h2>
<p>GraCom Services provided billing and facilities management services to small 
  medical clinics in Arlington and Irving in the early 90s. They wanted to connect 
  4 clinics to a central billing and business office. They wanted to use different 
  medical billing programs for different clinics, based on their size, but they 
  wanted to use a single custom program for collections work with insurance companies 
  and patients. </p>
<p><b>Most interesting business challenge</b>: understanding insurance billing 
  and collection practices. My research involved gaining an understanding the 
  state of the insurance collections art, and incentive based pay systems. We 
  eventually adopted a case management process, where each patient had a case 
  for each malady. The work for the collections staff was non-stop, and they found 
  it impossible to get a sense of progress or accomplishment. We created statistics 
  for the number of cases produced in a month, and then tracked the performance 
  of the collections staff individually and collectively to create a &quot;scoreboard&quot; 
  so that they would have some kind of feedback, and some sense of when a job 
  or job cycle ended. We also designed compensation based on those statistics.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenge</b>: converting the data from the two 
  billing programs into the collections program. This turned out to be more difficult 
  than simply mapping data fields from different formats because the organization 
  of the data was different in all three applications. We defined what was atomic 
  and what was summary and produced a solution that was effective: we batched 
  the charge details, the summary patient info, and the payment info from each 
  billing program into the collections program.</p>
