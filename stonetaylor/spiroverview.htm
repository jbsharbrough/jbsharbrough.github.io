That's the cycle that we follow in the pursuit of innovation in client firms.</p>
      <p><b><font color="#0000FF" size="4">Survey</font></b>. The survey stage is where 
        we try to understand the opportunity and the scope of solution available. 
        A survey could be as brief as an Initial Scope and Requirements Meeting 
        (ISR). It could also include the formation of a pursuit team to develop 
        recommendations for solutions. It might include various meetings at various 
        levels within the client organization. The deliverable for the survey 
        is a list of possible projects to address the opportunity, and their relative 
        returns on investment (ROI). Click <a href="bpmsurvey.htm">here</a> for 
        an example survey form.</p>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000" size="4">Plan</font></b>. The client goes back to
work. The planning stage is when we deliberate with the client to choose which
project(s) will be undertaken, to prioritize them, and to schedule resources, if
necessary. The deliverable for the plan is a written document that identifies
the project(s) to do, as well as the goals, scope, budgets, review points, and
roles for key participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font color="#339933" size="4">Implement</font></b>. The implementation
stage is old fashioned project management. We prepare weekly progress and
activity reports, and we keep the project moving.</p>
<p><font color="#CCCC00"><font size="4"><b>Review</b>.</font> </font>We realize
that every project is a gamble. The client is attempting to create an outcome by
following this path. There is no certainty that a given approach will produce
the outcome desired, or that it is the best way to produce that outcome. That
realization places special emphasis on the Review Phase. This is when we ask,
&quot;Is this working? Are we on the right course?&quot; Hey, things change. We
expect it, plan for it, and schedule time to assess the project in light of
those changes.</p>
