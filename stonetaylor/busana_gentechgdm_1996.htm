<h2><b>GENTECH, Genealogical Data Model, 1996. </b></h2>
<p>GENTECH is a genealogy society for bridging technology and genealogy. They 
  wanted to develop a technical definition for many of the terms and reports commonly 
  used in family history. Numerous developers were writing programs and using 
  a protocol named GEDCOM to export and import information, but it only exchanged 
  chart information. This was frowned on by traditional genealogists, who draw 
  a clear distinction between evidence and conclusions and feel like conclusions 
  without the supporting evidence are useless.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting business challenge</b>: First, we needed to get a group 
  that would be respected by the non-participants. We selected three leading software 
  developers, and three prominent traditional researchers. To that we added three 
  representatives of GENTECH, and a facilitator. The first JAD session was held 
  in Rochester in August of 1996. The project took three years, because the groups 
  had different languages, different domains of expertise, and they only met three 
  times a year for three days. The GENTECH Genealogical Data Model was published 
  in May of 1998. </p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenge</b>: to articulate the data types. 
  This was especially complicated for the audit trail to link evidence to conclusions. 
  The participants insisted that they be able to not only track the information 
  about this deduction, but that the system allow others to add their train of 
  thinking to it. The final product was an ERD with 30 objects. At about that 
  time, the Mormon Church published GEDCOM future directions and it contained 
  300 objects. It was my opinion that they used far too many, and that GENTECH 
  didn't use enough -- they avoided decomposing names, dates, and places.</p>
