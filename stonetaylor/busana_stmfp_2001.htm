<h2><b>ST Microelectronics, Facilities Projects, 2001.</b> </h2>
<p>The Facilities group at the ST Micro Carrollton site needed to coordinate the
status and budgets for a variety of physical plant projects. The project
managers took some Microsoft Access classes and then designed their application.
I was tasked with developing it in Access 2000. They wanted to accomplish two
things - track the status of a project, and track its performance against the
budget. The budget tracking was to be compared to the capital assets available
for those projects.</p>
<p><b>Biggest business challenge</b>: reducing the amount of entry required was
mission critical. The engineers responsible for managing the projects were not
going to spend a lot of time keying project updates into the application. The
managers for this development project were very helpful at specifying what
information came from which sources, and that allowed us to avoid asking users
for information that wasn't available. It was also very important to complete a
working project within the budget allocated to the project - there would be no
supplemental funding for overruns. The project was completed and installed for
less than 100 billable hours - including scoping, specification, coding,
testing, installation, and explanation.</p>
<p><b>Biggest technical challenge</b>: there were two. One was the level of the
integration of the database - it was as interrelated as I've encountered before
or since. The other was reducing an 11x17 spreadsheet to an 8-1/2x11 page for
the primary project review meeting document. Both were iterative processes that
eventually produced successful results.</p>
<p><b>Buzzwords</b>: Microsoft Access, application design, database design,
application development..</p>
