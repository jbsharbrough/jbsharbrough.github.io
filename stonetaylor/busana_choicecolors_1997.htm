<h2><b>Choice Homes, Color Selections 1997.</b> </h2>
<p>A regional VP at Choice Homes felt like they had an internal communication 
  problem related to the customer's choice of colors, cabinet finishes, and upgrades. 
  This is profitable add-on business, but only if you get it right the first time. 
  Often, the customer would tell the salesman what they wanted, but the information 
  would go through a manager for approval before getting to the construction superintendents 
  so that they could order materials and so that they could get the right ones. 
  The company's processing environment was Office, with a lot of Exchange and 
  Access. We eventually settled for an Excel Template on a network drive, and 
  emailing the information to the stakeholders so that everyone would have the 
  same documentation. We initially used it in one community, but within a year 
  four of the other twenty community managers had adopted it. Also, in 2000, one 
  of the community managers brought me in to write an application to take the 
  color selections info and use it in the adjustment of the standard budget for 
  the job.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting business challenge:</b> In researching the business problem, 
  I went to the sales offices. I found many different vintages of price lists 
  for upgrades. These documents were not neat looking, and the prices were definitely 
  not all the same. It became clear that we needed an application that would have 
  central control. We held JAD meetings, with two goals: first and foremost to 
  give everyone a say in an effort to get unity of buy-in; secondly to see if 
  there were parts of the problem scope that hadn't been included from the beginning. 
  We set up an easel and covered the walls with ideas of what people thought the 
  problems were, and what people thought we could do about them. On of the most 
  interesting business aspects was that the manager wanted to base his selling 
  price for many of the upgrades on his costs, and left me free to learn as much 
  as I could about how different costs behaved. Flooring, brick, mini-blinds, 
  and other items fell into behavior classes - same price for all floor plans, 
  different price for each floor plan, or groupings in between. Finally, the manager 
  required that the application to allow him to change the margins and to change 
  the level of rounding of the final prices when he felt that it was appropriate. 
</p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenge</b>: making the application flexible 
  enough. We settled on Excel instead of MS Access because the staff was familiar 
  with Excel, and they didn't want to have any delays caused by database or programming 
  oversights when they were sitting in front of the customer. Each customer's 
  information went into an excel worksheet, and then we periodically ran an MS 
  Access application to read and summarize those worksheets for management.</p>
<p><b>Buzzwords:</b> JAD, MS Office, Workflow.</p>
