<h2><b>Choice Homes, Bridges, 1992</b>. </h2>
<p>A residential builder is a manufacturer with a number of small, spread-out 
  manufacturing plants. In 1992, we tried to connect the remote subdivisions to 
  the corporate office using bridges instead of dialup. It was a good idea - they 
  could use Windows 3.0 to share email and documents and map drives. It didn't 
  work - we couldn't get the connection environment to be stable, and then one 
  of the bridges dropped, everyone on the network hung up for several minutes. 
  We had to back off and go to Frame Relay.</p>
