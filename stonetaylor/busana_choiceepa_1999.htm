<h2><b>Choice Homes, EPA, 1999. </b></h2>
<p>The EPA requires that an SWPPP form be filled out for every house that is in 
  process every 14 days, unless it rains more than 1/2&quot;, when a form must 
  be filled out within 24 hours. A community manager asked me to work with a superintendent 
  and automate this practice, because it took the man about 5 minutes per house 
  for 100 houses every time it rained. I researched the problem by asking the 
  EPA consultant about the data and forms required, then created a prototype and 
  asked her to get the EPA's blessing. They were pleased to see the effort, and 
  gave us the green light to try it.</p>
<p><b>Biggest business challenge</b>: the client did not want to pay for
development. We agreed that I would develop the application at my own expense,
and that any community manager who wanted to use it would pay me a setup fee. It was 
  somewhat difficult to adapt the application to other communities, when they 
  used different general ledger codes for certain phases of production.</p>
<p><b>Biggest technical challenge</b>: a one click inspection if nothing was found 
  out of order. Data was imported from the corporate SQL server when houses were 
  started and closed. The various steps in the manufacturing process that had 
  to have dates documented were captured from the Accounts Payable transactions 
  for the homes. It became clear that the application would have two parts - a
stand-alone database for keeping the required records and forms; and an optional
front-end that would extract information from the client's proprietary database
to reduce the amount of entry required by the superintendent.</p>
<p><b>Buzzwords</b>: JAD, Workflow, SQL.</p>
