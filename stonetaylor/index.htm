Taylor on sharbrough.net, it seemed like a good time to move the link. </p>
<p>=== ORIGINAL TEXT of the STONE TAYLOR site begins ===</p>
<p>Stone Taylor Associates consults with clients across the United States, 
        developing <b>internet strategies</b> and <b>business process strategies</b>. 
        Our goal is to transfer knowledge to clients about methods for using networks 
        to manage work.&nbsp;Most people hear that and their eyes glaze over and 
        they look around for something to drink.</p>
      <p>From the customer's viewpoint, many businesses look stupid. They forget 
        what they are told worse than a four year old. They don't live up to their 
        service commitments. Their promises ripen into their excuses. Often these 
        companies are groups of good people who just can't get over the hump without 
        some help.</p>
      <p>Our clients have worked in residential construction, health care, distribution, 
        manufacturing, and other services. Using computers and networks to help 
        those organizations provide better cheaper faster services, we adopted 
        the catchphrase: &quot;<b>Stone Taylor. Stop looking stupid.</b>&quot;</p>

<p>Do you have a website? Does it work for you? Are you getting information to
and from your customers like you want? Are you communicating with your vendors
like you want?&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>We code web pages, although we don't consider ourselves to be web coders.</li>
  <li>We design web sites, although we don't consider ourselves to be graphic or
    web designers.</li>
  <li>We develop internet strategies, to help you integrate internet technology
    into your fundamental business processes. We consider ourselves to be
    network strategists.</li>
</ul>
      <p>Do you buy or sell online? Do you use eCommerce? eBay? Do you want to?</p>
      <p>Affordable networks have changed the ball game for some business processes, 
        and we work with senior managers to make sure that they speak the language 
        that their staff understands, and that they can use this technology strategically 
        in pursuit of their business goals.</p>

      <p>Do you have difficulty satisfying your customers? Are your people having 
        to give them excuses instead of results? Do you have difficulty finding 
        out what is happening with particular orders? Does your financial information 
        get to you so late that it's useless? It might be time to back off a step 
        and ask yourself what you do and how you do it.</p>
      <p>Are your business processes as effective as you want? Are they as efficient 
        as your competition's? Does employee turnover kill your momentum? Do your 
        employees hustle?</p>
<ul>
  <li>We digitize business processes, although that's not our primary focus.&nbsp;</li>
        <li> We build communities of practice, although that's not our primary focus, 
          either.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>
We build strategies for managing processes, and that's our primary focus.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
      <p>Digitization of processes describes using electronic networks to move 
        information through an organization. Business processes take place in 
        an environment of technology infrastructure and corporate culture. Organizations 
        can align the interests of employees and improve the flow of information 
        through a review of opportunities for digitization of processes, compensation 
        options, training and education opportunities.</p>
      <p>Keeping business processes focused, and in sync with business priorities, 
        is like trying to keep the top of the counter clear. It takes a lot of 
        energy and you have to manage it constantly. </p>
