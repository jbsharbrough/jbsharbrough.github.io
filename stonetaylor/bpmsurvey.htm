<h2>Survey Questions for Clients</h2>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;This approach can be generally described as a
structural approach to how people work. I look for the outside parts (how they
interact externally) and the inside parts (how they stack ‘em and how they
string ‘em).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Performing this survey at several levels of an organization
can illuminate problems with alignment, structure, focus, communication, and
adaptability. The purpose of the survey is to understand which of those problems
can be leveraged best to serve the goals of the organization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The survey covers twelve categories:</p>
<ol style="margin-top:0in" start="1" type="1">

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>

everyone else is doing than they are about their own performance. Look for real
indications of political or personnel problems in the organization. Look for
indications that anything other than the work is occupying people’s minds.
This is actually very useful, if performed constructively. If each square on the
grid changes color based on its perception of the effectiveness of the cells
next to it, a pattern of “inflammation” would indicate possible areas where
attention should focus.]</p>
