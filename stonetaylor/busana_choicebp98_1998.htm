<h2><b>Choice Homes, BuildPro98 1998</b>. </h2>
<p>The president of Choice Homes was concerned that the company could do a better 
  job of communicating about the status of houses in process, and in particular 
  about scheduling and ordering the materials and labor for the houses. We started 
  a project in late 1997 called BuildPro98, which was an integration of PC and 
  Palm applications. After six months of coding and testing, we concluded that 
  we could not use this technology to address that problem at that time. It required 
  more computer savvy than most superintendents could supply. Some flourished, 
  others foundered. Also, at that time, before the modern reflective screens, 
  it was hard to read the Palm Pilots in bright sunlight, which was where the 
  superintendents needed to see them.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting business challenge</b>: mapping the data structures from 
  the corporate servers, to the local pc's, to the handheld computers. The local 
  superintendents only needed data for houses in process. The other challenge 
  was getting high quality information about the lead times and lag times to make 
  scheduling meaningful. </p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenge</b>: a one click entry to record that 
  an item was complete. We had no difficulty moving the information from SQL Server 
  to local MS Access applications. Using VBA to create appointments and tasks 
  in outlook was more difficult but largely a matter of typing carefully when 
  we coded. We just reversed the procedure later. It was clear that the future 
  of homebuilding involved transitioning the superintendents from labor foremen 
  to knowledge workers, but we couldn't implement it in 1998. It was also fun 
  to code the PO routine, which would either print, fax, or email a purchase order 
  based on present vendor information.</p>
