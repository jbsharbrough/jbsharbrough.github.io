<h2><b>Choice Homes, Original Database, 1988</b>.</h2>
<p> Dale LeMaster was the Data Processing Manager at Oil States and gave me my 
  first programming job in 1981. In 1988 he founded Choice Homes, a company with 
  sales of over $400 million in 2001. My assignment in 1988 was to design a database 
  to track the construction in process. I went to the construction superintendents 
  and to Dale until I understood the requirements, and created the original application 
  in interpretive dBase III. Later, we compiled it with Clipper, and then modified 
  it for multiuser Novell. After that, it became an Access app, and now resides 
  in SQL with an access front end. The basic data structures are unchanged.</p>
<p><b>Most interesting business challenge</b>: Making it easy enough for superintendents 
  to use. These are people who carry an amazing amount of information in their 
  heads, and feel heavily time constrained. Many aren't comfortable as knowledge 
  workers. By making walk lists for houses, we simplified the process of getting 
  that information into a form that someone else could enter for them, and thereby 
  keep the sales and managers informed about the status of production. </p>
<p><b>Most interesting technical challenge</b>: Tracking revisions of bills of 
  material. At first, there was only one subdivision. Later there were a hundred. 
  A given floor plan was not manufactured the same way in any two of them - Choice 
  is a very decentralized company. Keeping track of versions of bills of material 
  was something that we did not handle well from the beginning, and that I would 
  approach differently if I were to do it again.</p>
<p><b>Buzzwords</b>: dBase, Clipper, Novell, MS Access.</p>
