<p><b>GENERAL DISCLAIMER</b>.&nbsp; The reviews herein are
strictly my opinions, and are intended to help you find sources
that you wish to read.&nbsp; If any effort by me to review a work
crosses the copyright holder's idea of what's reasonable, that
copyright holder should email me and I'll accomodate them.&nbsp;
I accept no responsibility for any error or omission that might
be found here, but I'll do what I can to keep the links correct. </p>

<p><b>GENERAL IMPRESSION</b>.&nbsp; The Discoveries page of the
Dallas Morning News generally can be found on Mondays in the back
of the Business section of the paper.&nbsp; It might be aimed at
children, but I personally enjoy it (and I doubt that Tom
Siegfried's column is aimed at children).&nbsp; There is not
enough science and technology in the general press for me, so I
make it a point to catch this page every week </p>

<p><b>THE PARTICULARS (from the fine print)</b>.&nbsp;
Discoveries is copyright The Dallas Morning News. </p>

<p><b>HOW TO FIND THEM</b>.&nbsp; Website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/index/discoveries-nf.htm">http://www.dallasnews.com/index/discoveries-nf.htm</a>.
E-mail can be left there for a variety of departments. </p>
