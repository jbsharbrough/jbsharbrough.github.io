<p><b>GENERAL IMPRESSION</b>.&nbsp; Bottom Line Personal is one of the most satisfying
periodicals that I read, personally.&nbsp; They have a number of experts with which they
consult on issues ranging from investments to consumer concerns to family and health
issues.&nbsp; I've never read anywhere else how to pick up a puppy. </p>

opinions is no substitute for legal, accounting, investment, medical and other
professional services to suit your specific personal needs.&nbsp; Always consult a
