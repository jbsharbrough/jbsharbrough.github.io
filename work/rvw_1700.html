<p><b>GENERAL DISCLAIMER</b>.&nbsp; The reviews herein are
strictly my opinions, and are intended to help you find sources
that you wish to read.&nbsp; If any effort by me to review a work
crosses the copyright holder's idea of what's reasonable, that
copyright holder should email me and I'll accomodate them.&nbsp;
I accept no responsibility for any error or omission that might
be found here, but I'll do what I can to keep the links correct. </p>

<p><b>GENERAL IMPRESSION</b>.&nbsp; I read this magazine for two
things:&nbsp; John Dvorak and the Editor's Choice in product
tests.&nbsp; I'm sure that there are other things in there, but I
haven't found time to adopt them.&nbsp; Oops!&nbsp; Did I leave
out ARF?&nbsp; I read that first.&nbsp; As they say, they are the
independent guide to personal computing.&nbsp; There is a CDROM
and an OnLine version of the magazine. </p>

<p><b>THE PARTICULARS (from the fine print)</b>.&nbsp; PC
MAGAZINE (ISSN 0888-8507) is published twice a month except in
July and August by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company. </p>

<p><b>HOW TO FIND THEM</b>.&nbsp; Website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.zdnet.com">http://www8.zdnet.com/pcmag/</a>.
E-mail can be left there for a variety of departments. </p>
