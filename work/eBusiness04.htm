<h2>We are the betting animal.</h2>


<p>Deciding what new data to gather and what to do with it is not a simple choice. Cause
and effect are very hard to tease out sometimes. Peter Senge offers hope in his book <i>The
Fifth Discipline</i>. This book identifies and explains several of the basic cause and
effect relationships that compose systems analysis. The ability to analyze a system and
understand cause and effect is a critical skill when being the first to discover the cause
and effect relationship is so critical.</p>

<p>Until the Internet came along, knowing how a system worked was important, but being
able to act on that understanding was sometimes quite difficult. Getting audience with
your customers to explain a new service offering could take a business several months of
face to face meetings by the sales force, for example. Now a business can put a new
service offering on its website, email the information instantly to its customers,
suppliers and employees, and <i>voila!</i> The new program is rolled out.</p>

<p>The relationship between the value of understanding and the value of communicating just
changed. Communication is much simpler, and understanding is just as hard as ever.</font></p>
