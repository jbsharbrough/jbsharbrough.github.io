<p><b>GENERAL DISCLAIMER</b>.&nbsp; The reviews herein are
strictly my opinions, and are intended to help you find sources
that you wish to read.&nbsp; If any effort by me to review a work
crosses the copyright holder's idea of what's reasonable, that
copyright holder should email me and I'll accomodate them.&nbsp;
I accept no responsibility for any error or omission that might
be found here, but I'll do what I can to keep the links correct. </p>

<p><b>GENERAL IMPRESSION</b>.&nbsp; The Economist is my preferred
source of international news.&nbsp; In addition to their coverage
of the globe, the editorials seem to me to contain balance while
still taking a stand - something I don't see much anymore.&nbsp;
The surveys that they produce are textbooks in themselves, and
the primary source of information for me in almost every area
that they address. </p>

<p><b>THE PARTICULARS (from the fine print)</b>.&nbsp; THE
ECONOMIST (ISSN 0013-0613) is published every week, except for a
year-end double issue, by The Economist Newspaper, NA,
Incorporated. </p>

<p><b>HOW TO FIND THEM</b>.&nbsp; Website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com">www.economist.com</a>. E-mail can
be left there for a variety of departments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Numerous
articles and surveys are available on line with a subscription. </p>
