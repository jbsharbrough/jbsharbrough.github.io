<p>I enjoy Clint Eastwood in everything that doesn't have a
circus or a monkey. That said, I'm sure he can find something
better to do now that he's too old to play Dirty Harry anymore. I
had a few problems with this film but was generally entertained.
Ed Harris makes the difference in this one. I could add that I
never saw Scott Glenn play a buffoon, either.</p>

<p>Ok, this is a story about a burglar who is interrupted in the
middle of a burglary by two people coming into the house he is
burgling. He hides in a closet and witnesses a murder. This
murder involves the president of the US, and thereby hangs the
entire tale. He starts to leave the country, sees the president
with the widower he has created, and decides to stay and fight
the guy. Oh, yeah, he has an adult daughter who is a DA, er, a
prosecutor, and who he has never been close to. Or so she thinks.
Clint Eastwood has been close to her all the time -- he's a
master of disguise and a good photographer besides.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: He's running away from the secret
service, through the woods at night. They are chasing him with
night goggles on. They see him clearly several times, but never
fire a shot. Why don't they just shoot him there? <strong>Answer</strong>:
It's too early in the movie for them to kill him. Then what would
the story be about? <strong>Implication</strong>: The Hero gets
away in the beginning easier than in the end.</p>

<p><strong>Good Line from Ed Harris</strong>: &quot;A strong
burglar with a weak mind. Obviously another open and shut
case.&quot; I enjoyed all of the scenes featuring Harris in this
film. His chemistry with Eastwood was especially fun to watch.</p>

<p><strong>Good Image</strong>: As the Daughter got a headache,
her teapot began to whistle. Multimedia storytelling.</p>

<p><strong>Good Image</strong>: The Daughter's Refrigerator.
Clint Eastwood looks in it, she imagines he's looking in it.
Later, she sees the food he put in it. It becomes a bulletin
board for messages from father to daughter and vice versa.</p>

<p><strong>Good exchange</strong>: &quot;He doesn't want any
money.&quot; &quot;What are you, a psychiatrist now?&quot;
&quot;No, I read the back.&quot; &quot;(reading) I don't want any
money.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>I wish that just once, they'd</strong>: There was one
scene I called a Gun Ballet. Two hidden assassins wait for their
shot at Eastwood. They are assembling their guns methodically,
like preparation for religious rites. Click. Twist. Click. Snap.
First one, then the other. They would aim them at people in the
area and pull the trigger. Click. No bullet, I guess. It can't be
that they are going to try to kill Clint Eastwood with a
click-gun-- it will take a very loud noise.. I kept waiting for
someone to pinch his finger in one of those things, or to have
extra parts left over, or to accidentally shoot someone while
setting up the sights. It was so close to slapstick, but it never
went over the line. I think I enjoyed this scene too much.</p>

<p><strong>Irony in the movies</strong>: In one scene, the
daughter is in the hospital, and Eastwood is in the room. A bad
guy comes in to kill her, and Eastwood gets the upper hand and
kills the bad guy instead. All of this in the little hospital
room, with the daughter sleeping. The dialog goes:
&quot;Daddy.&quot; &quot;Go to sleep, darling.&quot; This is
repeated at least a million times a day by little girls whose
dads are turning off the lights or closing the windows, not
straddling a secret service guy on the floor that they are in the
act of killing.</p>

<p>On a five star scale, this movie goes right in the middle. Two
and a half stars.</p>
