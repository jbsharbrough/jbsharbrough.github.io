<h2>SCIENCE UPDATE</h2>

<p> Primate study finds grape hunt makes a monkey of
computer.&nbsp; A computer trying to find grapes, similar to the
mouse in the maze GA, did not fare better than monkeys in this
trial.&nbsp; The monkeys were working on the &#147;traveling
salesman&#148; problem - no jokes will be necessary.&nbsp;
Researchers hid grapes in holes in a grid while the monkeys
watched them, and then let the monkeys develop their own search
rules to get the grapes. <br>

<h2>SIEGFRIED</h2>

<p>Humans could learn new tricks from animal&#146;s decision
making <br>
Dr Peter Shizgal of Concordia University, in Current Opinion in
Neurobiology, says that animals make choices based on &#147;hard
wired&#148; values, &#147;as if they are anything but indifferent
to the consequences of their actions.&#148;&nbsp; It would appear
that their classifier rules, in his opinion, are all based on
very short term values - that they ignore everything but current
inputs. </p>

<p>The conclusion of the article:&nbsp; &#147;Someday, such
knowledge may offer hope of improving human decision
making.&nbsp; In the meantime, animals will remain the best
models making sound assessments leading to prompt
decisions.&nbsp; Except of course, for cats, who can never decide
whether they want to be indoors or out.&#148;&nbsp; I think that
the assessment of their decision strategy is way to generalized,
and too simplistic.&nbsp; It allows for no memory, and little
learning by the individual.&nbsp; I find that inconsistent with
my own view of animal behaviour above the insect level, and a bad
example for assessing human choices and methods of choosing. </p>
