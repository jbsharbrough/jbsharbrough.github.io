LEAD</h2>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
Mort Myerson<!--mstheme--></font></h3>


<p>The way to be a leader today is different.&nbsp; I no longer call the
shots.&nbsp; I&#146;m not the decision maker.&nbsp; The essence of leadership
today is to make sure that the organization knows itself.&nbsp; I am now
a coach, not an executive.&nbsp; When&nbsp; people ask me for a decision,
I pick up a mirror, hold it up for them to look into, and tell them:&nbsp;
Look to yourselves and look to the team, don&#146;t look to me.

<p>The three jobs of a leader:
Make sure that the organization knows itself
Pick the right people and create an environment where they can succeed
Be accessible

CHANGE</h2>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
Levi&#146;s<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
At Levi-Strauss, they did something as revolutionary as I can imagine.&nbsp;
A $7 billion dollar company redesigned the entire organization - all new
jobs, functions, the whole nine yards.&nbsp; Then every employee interviewed
for one of the new jobs.&nbsp; Some employees tried for their first and
second choices and failed.&nbsp; This was very disturbing to them, and
was the biggest negative associated with the program.&nbsp; The positives
were that they learned a lot about the people that they had - I didn&#146;t
know she had a degree in chemistry! - and that each employee was forced
to ask themselves where and how they could create value in the organization.

<p>The book of the new company was not generally circulated.&nbsp; Employees
who requested it got it.

<p>On dealing with resistance to change, there are three rules:
  <!--mstheme--></font><!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <!--msthemelist--><tr><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="../_themes/canvas/acnvbul2.gif" width="12" height="12" hspace="15" alt="bullet"></td><td valign="top" width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="Arial, Arial, Helvetica">

When a disappointed employee cried, she got two messages.&nbsp; First,
don&#146;t let this take away from what you&#146;ve accomplished.&nbsp; You&#146;ve contributed
a lot to this company.&nbsp; Second, think more broadly about your role
here.&nbsp; Many of your skills are transferable.&nbsp; Why are you limiting
yourself?&nbsp; Where else can you add value?

<p>The most important advice:&nbsp; &#147;Find where you can add value in your
company and go after it.&nbsp; It may not be in the job you&#146;re in now.&nbsp;
It may not be in the job you like best.&nbsp; But that&#146;s what matters --
adding value.&nbsp; That&#146;s where you find security and fulfillment.&#148;
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
What Comes After What Comes Next<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
How can you develop your ability to anticipate the future?
<br> LEARN TO BE A BETTER LISTENER.&nbsp; You don&#146;t listen with
your mouth open.&nbsp; If you sell Kool Aid, don&#146;t hang out at the grocery
store when the kids are in school.
<br> ONCE A WEEK, READ A TRADE MAGAZINE FROM A DIFFERENT INDUSTRY.&nbsp;
Find two things that relate to your business or provoke your thinking.
<br> LET YOUR KIDS TUTOR YOU IN A SUBJECT THEY KNOW MORE ABOUT
THAN YOU DO.&nbsp; It&#146;s humbling.&nbsp; You don&#146;t have all the answers,
and you should listen to people that you never thought could teach you
anything.
<br> VOLUNTEER.&nbsp; This is the great equalizer - all volunteers
are peers.&nbsp; It strips away the power, and changes your perspective
on hierarchy and authority.
<br> READ WHAT HAS STOOD THE TEST OF TIME.&nbsp; Aristotle, Shakespeare,
Adam Smith, The Federalist Papers.&nbsp; People still put fresh flowers
on the grave of Leopold&nbsp; the First.&nbsp; Isn&#146;t that the impact you
want to have on your company?&nbsp; Reading things that last 300 years
helps frame thinking that lasts 300 years.
<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
Change Commandments<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
The rate of change is changing.&nbsp; Think about the speed of a stagecoach
versus a train, a car, or a rocket ship.&nbsp; We&#146;ve moved thruough those
four technologies in less than 150 years.

<p>You&#146;ve got to take the fear out of change.

<p>Winning companies will help people maintain their personal rates of
change.

<p>Ten ways the Net changes everything.
<br>1. Nets route around greed.
<br>2. Generosity begets prosperity.
<br>3. Open systems win over time.
<br>4. You can&#146;t predict the future.
<br>5. More is different.
<br>6. There&#146;s safety in speed.
<br>7. Win-win beats win-lose.
<br>8. Familiarity overcomes inertia.
<br>9. There is no central control of anything.
<br>10. No one is as smart as everyone.

The Trillion-dollar Vision of Dee Hock<!--mstheme--></font></h3>
Associates:&nbsp; Hire and promote first on the basis of integrity; second,
motivation; third, capacity; fourth, understanding; fifth, knowledge; and
least and least, experience.
<br>Compensation:&nbsp; Money motivates neither the best people, nor the
best in people.&nbsp; It can move the body and influence the mind, but
it cannot touch the heart or move the spirit; tha is reserver for belief,
principle, and morality.
<br>Form and Substance:&nbsp; Preserve substance, modify form.&nbsp; The
closest thing to a law of nature in business is that form has an affinity
for expense, while substance has an affinity for income.
<br>Leadership:&nbsp; 40% yourself, 30% your boss, 15% your peers.&nbsp;
Use the remained to teach the same theory to your subordinates.&nbsp; Lead
yoursefl, lead your superiors, lead your peers, and free your people to
do the same.
<br>Organization:&nbsp; An organization&#146;s success has enormously more to
do&nbsp; with clarity of a shared purpose, common principles and strength
of belief in them than to assets, expertise, operating ability, or management
competence.
<br> The organization must be adaptable and responsive to changing
conditions, while preserving overall cohesion and unity of purpose.
<br> The trick is to find the delicate balance that allows the
system to avoid turf fights and back-stabbing on the one hand, and authoritarian
micromanagement on the other.
<br> The organization must cultivate equity, autonomy, and individual
oportunity.
<br> The organization&#146;s governing structure must distribute power
and function to the lowers level possible.
<br> The governing structure must not be a chain of command, but
rather a framework for dialogue, deliberation, and coordination among equals.

<p>&#147;Think about it.&nbsp; There are other companies in the outsourcing
business who can offer equipment, supplies, and people.&nbsp; Our only
differentiator is the kind of community we are... It&#146;s self-evident.&nbsp;
That&#146;s why we&#146;ve got to create an organization where everyone has a lot
of knowledge of the business.&#148;

<p>What does it take to have an organization with that kind of knowledge?&nbsp;
&#147;You start by changing how you think about the organization.&nbsp; I think
of our organization as a dynamic, living system, like an environment.&nbsp;
You can&#146;t treat a natural system like a machine.&nbsp; All you can do is
create experience that disturb a natural system, and then it decides how
to respond.&nbsp; It&#146;s more a amtter of offering people different perspectives
and influencing their thinking than trying to drive them.&#148;

<p>It sounds indirect.&nbsp; Why not a more top-down approach?&nbsp; &#147;When
I got this job, my assignment was to create an empowerment strategy.&nbsp;
It turns out you can&#146;t empower anyone.&nbsp; This is not the freeing of
the slaves.&nbsp; The only thing that makes sense to me is to think of
empowerment as an outcome of organizational conditions.&nbsp; You create
an environment for learning, with empowerment as an outcome.&nbsp; When
you start to think like that, you go from an empowerment strategy to a
change strategy to where we are now -- it&#146;s just our business strategy.&#148;

<p>What are the core principles of the change program?&nbsp; &#147;Let&#146;s be
clear:&nbsp; it&#146;s never been a &#145;program.&#146;&nbsp; And unlike most other companies,
we&#146;ve never had a big change team.&nbsp; We just had some things we wanted
to try.&nbsp; We knew the first piece of our change strategy -- to create
a shared vision.&nbsp; Bit I never thouhgt of it as a written vision statement.&nbsp;
To me, a vision is an ongoing conversation ... It&#146;s never frozen, it&#146;s
never set.&#148;

<p>So how did you go about creating a shared vision?&nbsp; &#147;We did &#145;visioning
exercises&#148; and learned how to have conversations together.&nbsp; We got
a group of 120, then a conference with 400.&nbsp; Our vision became a living
thing, not a plastic card.&nbsp; Ask the people, &#145;What&#146;s a shared vision?&#146;&nbsp;
They&#146;ll tell you, &#145;A shared vision is the way we talked with each other
when we got together in Orlando.&#146;&#148;

<p>What came after creating a shared vision?&nbsp; &#147;Trust.&nbsp; Trust
is one of the essentials for learning.&nbsp; Stephen Covey&#146;s idea is that
people have emotional bank accounts.&nbsp; You create trust through deposits.&nbsp;
I think when we started we were probably running a deficit.&nbsp; We simply
hadn&#146;t done much for the people in the organization to build trust, to
make deposits in an emotional account..&nbsp; I can see the results of
out conference on this today.&nbsp; When the policy committee is considering
a decision, you&#146;ll hear someone ask, &#145;Will the people in our organization
see this as a deposit or a withdrawal?'&nbsp; &#145;Will it build trust or diminish
trust?&#146;&#148;

<p>Eight Principles for Learning:
<br>1. Learning is fundamentally social.
<br>2. Cracking the whip stifles learning.
<br>3. Learning needs an environment that supports it.
<br>4. Learning crosses heirarchical bounds.
<br>5. Self-directed learning fuels the fire.
<br>6. Learning by doing is more powerful than memorizing.
<br>7. Failure to learn is often the fault of the system, not the people.
<br>8. Sometimes the best learning is unlearning.
