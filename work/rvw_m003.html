<p><strong>Summary</strong>: This is a pretty good movie. It has
a little bit of Maine in it, but they don't all talk like
stereotypical Maine people.</p>

<p><strong>Plot Summary</strong>: A young lady gets out of a
Maine prison, and gets a job in a restaurant in Maine. She
changes the entire town. The plot does not follow your normal
formula.</p>

<p><strong>Question</strong>: At the climax of the movie, the
Girl is running to save Eli from the Posse. She doesn't get there
in time. However, when the first guy from the Posse gets to Eli,
he doesn't shoot him or even come close. It's almost as if she
didn't have to be protecting him in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Good Line: </strong>&quot;You can say that twice, and
mean it.&quot; Apparently, they don't say, &quot;You can say that
again,&quot; in Maine.</p>

<p>On a five star scale, this movie goes above the middle. Three
and a half stars.</p>
