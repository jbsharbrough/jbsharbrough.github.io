Red Planet's wonders<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<h2>SCIENCE UPDATE</h2>

<p> <strong>Ants appear to let guard down to allow bees to
pollinate trees</strong>. Certain flowers send out a signal to
their guardian ants to bug off for a few hours, allowing bees to
pollinate them.<br>
 <strong>Age when language is learned may affect how brain
stores it.</strong> A study shows that a language is stored in a
different part of your brain if it is learned at a different age.
If you learn two languages at an early age, they are stored in
the same place.<br>
 <strong>Child-care centers often don't position babies safely
for sleep</strong>. About half of the centers risk SIDS episodes
by letting infants sleep on their stomachs.<br>
 <strong>Study of clogged arteries in mice may yield new
genetic clues about obesity</strong>. Mice gain weight without
overeating in the absence of these new-found genes. The same
mechanism will be sought in humans. [I find it difficult to
believe that people or mice gain weight unless they eat more than
they burn.]<br>
 <strong>Matters of the heart</strong>. Two recent studies
suggest that genetics not only influences who has heart attacks,
but how well people do after them.<br>
<strong> Information inundation</strong>. Some Maryland
biologists at the Institute for Genomic Research in Rockville
just released 40 million letters of genetic code, containing
information from 11 different organisms. It was the larges
release of genetic information ever, and came one day after the
institute ended its alliance with Human Genome Sciences. The
change in relationship allowed the release of the information.
[Those of you expecting the second album to be as good as the
first one, just remember Christopher Cross.]</p>

<h2>PHYSIOLOGY</h2>

<p><strong>Estrogen called key in men's bone development. </strong>Until
recently, scientists thought that in men, testosterone was
responsible for ending the adolescent growth spurt and for
maintaining men's dense bones. Estrogen was thought to do the
same in women. Surprise! A 38 year old man in Italy was still
growing, and his bones were soft. His system produced no
estrogen. During estrogen treatments, his bones hardened up like
normal. [It is not yet widely known, but women produce small
amounts of male sex hormone, and vice versa. The role of these
hormones is still being discovered, as in this case.]</p>

<h2>SIEGFRIED</h2>

<p>Pathfinder mission is worth its weight in Martian money<br>
This article includes the top ten reasons why sending Pathfinder
to Mars was not a waste of money:</p>

<p>10. It cost less than making movies about going to Mars.<br>
9. Viewers living in cities with cable companies wise enought to
carry the NASA channel had somethings to watch on TV for a
change.<br>
8. Great pictures are now available for the next editions of Mars
geology textbooks.<br>
7. For a few days everybody forgot about OJ.<br>
6. Mars is a safer place for robots than Mir is for astronauts.<br>
5. It diverted attention from Roswell's alien landing
anniversary.<br>
4. It scoped out a good location for the sequel to <em>Men in
Black</em>.<br>
3. The weather there was better than in Dallas for a Fourth of
July weekend.<br>
2. Scientists are now happy for the first time since Jupiter got
blasted by a comet.<br>
1. It found a good place to send Mike Tyson.</p>

<p>A section justifying the cost of the mission: &quot;In the
end, when you add up the costs, Pathfinder's price tag came to
$266 million, just about a dollar per American. As AP science
editor Matt Crenson pointed out in his story, people 'spend eight
times that much to see fake dinosaurs eat character actors.' (He
might have added that some people will spend 50 times as much to
see one boxer try to eat another one.)&quot; [They don't call it
pugilism for nothing.]</p>

<p>But seriously, folks, Mr Siegfried says that some of the other
things that you get for your dollar are: &quot;Knowledge about
another world. Insight into the excitement generated when
curiosity is harnessed in the pursuit of understanding nature.
The satisfaction of knowintg that the spirit of exploration still
infects the human race, keeping it alive -- and making the human
brain worth having.&quot;</p>
