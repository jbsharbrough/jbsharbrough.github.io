Lessons in Increasing Intelligence<!--mstheme--></font></H3>
Article from Robert Sternberg, PhD, IBM professor of psychology and education
in the dept of psychology at Yale.

<P>Intelligence tests don&#8217;t work because they measure a narrow range of
abilities, and those abilities &#8220;are inert -- they don&#8217;t predict or lead
to actions or commonsense mental skills necessary to achieve life&#8217;s important
goals.&nbsp; They also don&#8217;t measure your ability to think.&#8221;

<P>Sternberg&#8217;s keys to &#8220;successful intelligence&#8221; include:
<BR>Analytical thinking -- the ability to solve problems and judge ideas.
<BR>Creative thinking -- the ability to formulate new or clever solutions
to problems.
<BR>Practical thinking -- the ability to use your ideas and implement them
effectively.
<BR>He recommends a balance among these three aspects.&nbsp; Steps to developing
them follow.
<H4><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
ANALYTICAL INTELLIGENCE<!--mstheme--></font></H4>
Recognize that there is a problem.
<BR>Define the problem.
<BR>Represent information about a problem accurately.
<BR>Invest resources.
<BR>Allocate resources wisely.
<BR>Track your progress during the problem-solving process.
<H4><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE<!--mstheme--></font></H4>
Actively seek out and plan to become a role model.
<BR>Question assumptions and encourage others to do so, too.
<BR>Take sensible risks and encourage others to do the same.
<BR>Allow yourself and others to make mistakes.
<H4><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
PRACTICAL INTELLIGENCE<!--mstheme--></font></H4>
Recognize your pattern of strengths and weaknesses.
<BR>Strengthen those skills in which you excel.
<BR>Believe in yourself.

<P>[How&#8217;s it relate to us and our work?&nbsp; Measuring the ability to
think could be very useful.&nbsp; If you are designing a smart company
and a learning company, being able to assess the thinking capacity of your
staff is important.&nbsp; Analyzing the different kinds of intelligence
is one method of getting to a method of assessment that could be useful.]

Baby Boomers and the Coming Investment Boom<!--mstheme--></font></H3>
Baby Boomers are likely to continue the investment boom, bringing the Dow
to 18,000 in about a decade.&nbsp; There is a strong correlation between
the S&amp;P500 and the number of people in their peak spending years:&nbsp;
which peaks at age 46.&nbsp; As people get that old, they begin to same
more.&nbsp; Between 2003 and 2009, the market should boom.&nbsp; Then it
may bust.

<P>[This is a great example of linear thinking.&nbsp; There are so many
reasons why it might not come to pass.&nbsp; Then again, I thought that
pre-paid phone cards would be a stupid idea.]
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
The top performing funds of 1997...<!--mstheme--></font></H3>
are likely to be in last year&#8217;s least popular categories.&nbsp; Funds in
the categories that grew the least on a percentage basis in one year outperformed
the average fund over the next one-, two- and three-year periods 79% of
the time.&nbsp; They outperfomed the most popular funds 92% of the time.

<P>[This is more linear thinking.&nbsp; A clearer understanding of the
relationship between the cause and effect might come in really handy.]
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
No More Procrastination<!--mstheme--></font></H3>
Change procrastination into action by challenging yourself to get a task
done in less than a half-hour ... and then committing yourself to an even
shorter time period for the next task.

<P>Or ... promise yourself that you will start working on a project for
just 10 minutes and then quit if you get bored. [This one works for me]
<BR>If you continue to have trouble getting started, figure out why.&nbsp;
You may need clarification or help from someone else.
<BR>Reward yourself for completing parts of any project -- perhaps by taking
a walk ... spending a few minutes reading an article that interests you
... or taking another type of short break.
<H3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">
Sexual harassment by coworkers<!--mstheme--></font></H3>
is twice as common as harassment by supervisors.&nbsp; Half of the sexual-harassment
complaints studied involved victim&#8217;s perrs or coworkers.&nbsp; One-quarter
involved supervisors.

<P>[Again, what is the likelihood that harassment by supervisors is unreported
in higher percentages than by coworkers?]
