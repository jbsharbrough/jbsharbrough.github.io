    customer, of doing business across the world versus across town. That two edged sword
    works for the firm and all of its competitors. First, you can do business in geographic
    places where you could not provide services cost effectively or competitively before.
    Second, your distant competitors can do the same to you. Third, there is a greater
    emphasis on knowing a firm&#146;s core competencies and using them for competitive

  <dd>A systematic investigation of a firm&#146;s activities will show that some tasks are
    about moving information (shipping bits), others are about moving things (shipping atoms).
    The information can be moved almost instantly to almost everywhere. Some firms are using
    this approach to gain a competitive advantage. </dd>
  <dd><br>
    That&#146;s what allows firms to put order entry and customer service on the web, for
    example, and handle more people. Cisco has had a six fold increase in sales since 1994,
    but has only doubled the customer support staff. A manufacturing company like Dell spends
    a fraction of what a steel maker or auto maker spends to produce an additional dollar in
    sales. Leveraging information technology to lower the cost of doing business is not a new
    phenomenon, but it is a current opportunity for competitive advantage. This advantage will
    be less pronounced when every other firm in an industry adapts the approach.</dd>

    </i>The low incremental cost of supplying additional copies of packaged information allows
    managers to focus on opportunities for &quot;increasing returns.&quot; A firm like
    Microsoft can produce an additional dollar of sales without tying up any additional

  <dd>There are two kinds of advantage to using these robots: lower unit costs and faster
    information feedback cycles. It costs 1 cent to do a bank transaction on the internet, 27
    cents with an ATM. Airline tickets can be sold for $1 on the web, $8 otherwise. </dd>

    A minimum wage full time employee costs a firm about $250 per week in operating expenses.
    Most of them have computers on their desks that can do 80% of the work without them.
    Let&#146;s face it &#150; very little of the work that people do requires a person&#146;s
    unique judgement, insight, and creativity. It involves drudgery, translating orders from
    voice to data, entering numbers that came from some other computer, processing
    transactions according to strict rules. Eventually, all humans will be doing one of four
    jobs: clown, judge, programmer, or sales clerk. Most likely you&#146;ll get a random
    assignment each week telling you which one you have to do.</dd>

  <dd>The internet changes the buyer and seller relationship. Buyers can easily choose between
    a number of sellers, if the information is available. Sellers can&#146;t be relied on to
    provide this information objectively. This creates a market opportunity for an
    &quot;infomediary&quot; to gather information and provide a platform for buyers and
    sellers to do business. eBay, Priceline, and a number of other firms have already
    identified markets for themselves. With so many trucks empty, hotel rooms empty, and plane
    seats empty, spot markets, with flexible prices, will proliferate for some time.<br>
