<p><b>GENERAL DISCLAIMER</b>.&nbsp; The reviews herein are
strictly my opinions, and are intended to help you find sources
that you wish to read.&nbsp; If any effort by me to review a work
crosses the copyright holder's idea of what's reasonable, that
copyright holder should email me and I'll accomodate them.&nbsp;
I accept no responsibility for any error or omission that might
be found here, but I'll do what I can to keep the links correct. </p>

<p><b>GENERAL IMPRESSION</b>.&nbsp; Fast Company is a publication
that seems to anticipate exactly what I need to know in my
work.&nbsp; I like the irreverence and the seriousness that they
exhibit simultaneously.&nbsp; Articles from how native american
councils make decisions to the management ideas of Dee Hock and
John Seely Brown to studies in learning exercises make it one of
the most important ones that I read. </p>

<p><b>THE PARTICULARS (from the fine print)</b>.&nbsp; FAST
COMPANY&nbsp; (ISSN 1085-9241) is published bi-monthly by US News
&amp; World Report and the Atlantic Monthly Company. </p>

<p><b>HOW TO FIND THEM</b>.&nbsp; Website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com">www.fastcompany.com</a>. E-mail
can be left there for a variety of departments. </p>
