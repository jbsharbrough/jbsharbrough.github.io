    The Discoveries section of the Dallas Morning News often
    features articles of relevance to non-linear dynamic
    systems.&nbsp; The various sections are here identified, and
    where there is special interest, reviewed.

<h2>NEUROSCIENCE</h2>

<h3><!--mstheme--><font color="#663399">DOORS TO PERCEPTION: Scientists look to vision research as
avenue to understanding consciousness<!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p>The brain manipulates sensory input to create mental pictures,
or &quot;percepts.&quot;</p>

<p>The function of awareness is to take what's currently around
me, make a compact representation, filtered through my
experience, my memories, my expectations, and make this
accessible to planning,&quot; according to Dr Christof Koch at
CalTech Pasadena.</p>

<p>Blindsight -- being able to perform a task that you can't
describe or see -- tells researchers about how the brain works.
Researchers assume that the perception does not make it to the
&quot;conscious&quot; brain. I think that the jury is out on
that. It doesn't make it to the verbal brain. It may be that the
conscious brain is not one and the same thing as the place where
we think words.</p>

<p>Researchers say that philosophers have tried to explain
consciousness for 2,000 years without success. They want a
scientific explanation. It sounds like a mechanistic explanation,
and I'll be happy to watch them talk about it on Oprah. Oh, darn.
I don't watch Oprah -- I'm at work!</p>

<h2>SCIENCE UPDATE</h2>

<p> Study probes watery mystery of creating castles in the sand<br>
 Size, density of particles may impact aerosol drug delivery<br>
 Ice core study offers evidence of dramatic swings in climate<br>
 Some health risks appear overplayed, other underplayed in news
accounts</p>

<h2>ASTRONOMY</h2>

<p>Space telescope's makeover yields sharper insights into the
universe.</p>

<p>The February 1997 makeover of the Hubble has produced &quot;a
new window into the early universe.&quot; While one of the new
cameras isn't working at all, the infrared images are helping
scientists explore.</p>

<h2>SIEGFRIED</h2>

<p>Science's high-tech distortions magnify economic inequality<br>
</p>

<p>Freeman Dyson says that scientific advances have created a
larger wealth gap. Machines have displaced unskilled labor. In
the 20s, JBS Haldane said that it was because science has no
&quot;ethical guidance. And society has no ethical context for
coping with the technological gifts that science confers.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr Dyson is sensitive to the River Jordan that has always
existed between the haves and the have nots. You can cross it,
but very few people go both ways</p>

<p>I think that it might be that the haves are able to act on
opportunities in ways that the wannabes cannot. Science produces
many new opportunities. Just wait until Bill Gates gives away a
billion dollars. Someone else, perhaps less fortunate but also
tuned to opportunities, will cross that river between poverty and
porsche.</p>
