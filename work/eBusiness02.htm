<p>John Holland&#146;s pioneering work in complex adaptive systems (CAS) yields a
simplified cycle of sensation, calculation, and action. In <i>Hidden Order</i>, we learn
about any number of creatures who gather information from the environment through
&quot;sensors.&quot; They act on the environment through &quot;effectors.&quot; The choice
of the effector is based on rules, for which values are constantly re-assigned based on
experience. These building blocks allow modeling of CAS behavior.</p>

<p>One of the most fascinating discoveries that Holland made was that more specific rules
have greater value than less specific rules. An example might be the difference in rules
that apply to all creatures moving toward you, and rules that apply to creatures moving
toward you that you enjoyed eating in the past. A similar example would be the relative
value of identifying red berries versus identifying the red berries that made you sick
last month. The most modern one would be the ability of a female human to tell the
difference between an attractive male human and an attractive male human with a Corvette.</p>

<p>A related point about the computation that CAS perform is that the information
extracted from the environment should be fresh. It doesn&#146;t help as much to realize
that a large bird is swooping down on you if the realization is based on observations from
two minutes ago. This concept relates to the cybernetic rule that the efficiency of any
controller is related to the quality of its feedback. The efficiency of any rule is based
on the quality of its feedback.</p>

<p>Businesses work in much the same way as other CAS because, above a certain size, they
ARE CAS. Burger King put SQL servers in every store, but they still couldn&#146;t tell how
many hamburgers that they sold each day. A firm can only manage what it can measure &#150;
in Holland&#146;s terms, what it can detect through its sensors. It can only act by doing
something that it already has the ability to do -- exercising its effectors. </p>

<p>The implication of the Internet revolution is that firms can gather information that
they could never gather before, and in a time frame that they could never realistically
achieve before. From a web store, a firm can tell which customers buy how often, and how
much they spend per order. It is easier to tell which vendors are dependable if you can
tell what average delivery times are than if you can&#146;t.</p>

<p>The combination of computing power and networking gives firms the opportunity to grow
new sense organs, and to develop new rules for action. The challenge for eManagers is to
choose what new things to measure, by divining relationships between outcomes and inputs
that weren&#146;t gathered before. If the customers enter their orders into your system,
and the vendors enter the invoices, and the financial closings are done in two days
instead of two weeks, a firm finds a lot of man-hours available for looking at large
databases for those relationships. One of the most likely uses of &quot;data mining&quot;
is the assignment of priorities to measures that were never tracked before.</p>

<p>The desired outcome is for managers to have more timely information about where the
business actually is, and better indications about where it is going.</font></p>
