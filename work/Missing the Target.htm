</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Disagreements in relationships are often based on our perceptions of the intentions of our partners. Staying away from the bulls-eye means knowing what kinds of actions could be fatal to the relationship and avoiding them.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>LABEL THE TARGET</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Imagine a target with a red bulls-eye, with a white circle around that, and another red and another white and so on until there are 10 levels. Imagine that there is a 1 in the outermost circle and a 10 in the center.</P>
<P>Ask your partner what kinds of things go in which circles. Saying her hair is not straight. Laughing if she spills a drink. Having sex with her sister. Twice. Find out what goes in what circles.</P>
<P>Then be honest, and tell her the same things about yourself. The 8, 9, and 10 stuff should be real deal-busters, the kind of thing that you have to leave the house and think over really hard.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>STAY OUT OF THE MIDDLE</P>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><P>Stay out of the three inner circles. Always. All the time. Not just don’t get caught. Don’t even think about it.</P>
<P>This approach won’t necessarily ensure that you’ll make it in your relationship. What it will do is enable you to talk about it when you disagree.</P></FONT></BODY>
