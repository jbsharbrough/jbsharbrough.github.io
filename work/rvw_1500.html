<p><b>GENERAL DISCLAIMER</b>.&nbsp; The reviews herein are strictly my
opinions, and are intended to help you find sources that you wish to read.&nbsp;
If any effort by me to review a work crosses the copyright holder's idea
of what's reasonable, that copyright holder should email me and I'll accomodate
them.&nbsp; I accept no responsibility for any error or omission that might
be found here, but I'll do what I can to keep the links correct.

<p><b>GENERAL IMPRESSION</b>.&nbsp; Harper's is a magazine that keeps me
in balance.&nbsp; I read a lot of science and technology publications,
and I get a bit of a bias that Harper's balances out.&nbsp; I never agree
with Lewis Lapham and he's always right.&nbsp; So I buy the magazine, read
the editorials, and try to learn something.&nbsp; I'll never forget the
editorial about the George Bush Invasion of Panama.&nbsp; I've never performed
such a quick 180 in my thinking outside of an argument with a woman.

<p><b>THE PARTICULARS (from the fine print)</b>.&nbsp; HARPER'S MAGAZINE
(ISSN0017-789X) is owned and published monthly by the Harper's Magazine
Foundation.

<p><b>HOW TO FIND THEM</b>.&nbsp; Website:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.harpers.org">www.harpers.org</a>.
E-mail can be left there for a variety of departments.
