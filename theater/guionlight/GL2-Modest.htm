<font FACE="Impress BT">

<p>1) A&amp;M is a haven for tradition. We have Yell Practice, Yells, Silver Taps, Muster,
a Code of Honor, the Corps of Cadets, Junction Survivors, and E King Gill. We also have 40
years of Aggie Players tradition. </p>

<p>2) It&#146;s not like we want. The Aggie Players are not what we would want. There are
too few productions. There are too many bad productions. The number of Theater Arts majors
is down. The university has a resident playwright who has nothing to do with the Aggie
Players. That&#146;s bogus.</p>

<p>3) We let it get this way. Each of us has allowed this to happen by apathetically
neglecting to maintain a connection with the Aggie Players. In some cases, it&#146;s
pushing twenty years.</p>

<p>4) We need to decide what to do about it. If you care about the quality of theater at
A&amp;M, you should:
<ul>
  <u>
  <li>Write letters and voice your opinions</u>. Send your message to the Dean of Liberal
    Arts, the English Department Head, and the Theater Arts Section Head. You can contact the
    President or the Chancellor or the Batt if you like. Next issue, I&#146;ll publish those
    names and addresses. But you can&#146;t get anyone to give you something if all you do is
    complain. Let them know that you respect the traditions of TAMU and are concerned that the
    practice of valuable traditions is falling away.</li>
  <u>
  <li>Go to plays</u>. Pay full price. Meet the students and faculty - Coach would love to see
    each and every one of you. Let them know that you claim ownership of Theater Arts at
    A&amp;M and you will evaluate their stewardship.</li>
  <u>
  <li>Stay in touch, stay informed</u>. Communicate with other Old Aggie Players once in a
    while. It&#146;s amazing how easy it is to pick up where the last conversation ended.
    Share your hopes for the future of theater at A&amp;M. Let them know that you care about
    preserving part of that special A&amp;M experience.</li>
  <u>
  <li>Build from within the existing structure</u>. Encourage everyone that you contact to
    build and to grow. It will work a lot better than if you recommend that they all take a
    flying leap off the smokestack. Offer support, time, and money if you think it will help.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the Aggie Players ceases to be the production arm of the Theater Arts Section, a
fire will go out that can never be rekindled. If you let it happen without taking a stand,
or trying to help, you won&#146;t have griper&#146;s rights later.</p>
