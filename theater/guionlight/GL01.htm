<font FACE="Comix" size="3">Here it is

<p>As I left Uvalde in 1992, I intended to go home and start on a newsletter right away.
Sorry indeed is the guy who takes 2-1/2 years to get a round tuit... So here it is. I am
having some fun here, and I hope that you do, too. But there is more to this than just
having fun, as I have told many of you over the years. Or did I just intend to? There are
a couple of things that we need to do, but they all fall under the category of NEVER
FORGET.</p>

<p>In Uvalde, I realized that we all learned something special in the Aggie players: to
take care of each other. We shared a lot of time, we shared the stage, we took turns being
onstage, backstage, lead roles, supporting roles. And when I saw you together again, it
seemed shockingly normal. There was Steve king talking to Celina in the kitchen, and it
just seem't normal and right. So what should we never forget? That we are supposed to take
care of each other, and that there is something bigger than each one of us out there, and
that it's worthwhile to put a little energy into preserving an environment where that can
happen.</p>

<p>So enjoy this newsletter, I'd like to make another someday soon, and be ready to do
something to make it possible for others to do the same.</p>

<p>Volunteer, ok?</b></u></p>

<p>We need to do several things: establish an Aggie Players Library; speak as a group to
the university administration - supporting the Aggie players as a production arm of the
theater arts section; and give people a place where they can look the rest of us up.</p>
