<p>So rumor has is that</font></font></b><font FACE="Impress BT" SIZE="4"><font FACE="FanciHand"> ... <b>Steve King</b> was in
Ohio on business, and was called at his hotel by the local radio station - seems that his
name resembled an author of horror novels or something... we're hoping to hear the tapes
someday. <b>Michael Wilson</b> wants to have a get together in Leona again. What do you
think? <b>Walt Meissner</b> and I have been communicating on the Internet regularly, and
it's so convenient. If you have an email address, let us know. We'll send you a message,
you bet.</font><b><img src="../../images/gl1pg2-1.gif" alt="JULIE SINGS &quot;TRASH&quot;" align="right" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="179"></b><font FACE="FanciHand"></p>

<p>It seems like a good idea to start up an <b>Aggie Player library</b>. The scripts in
Coach's office aren't a bad place to start. But there are missing playbills, and there are
other things like photos, etc, that we need to dig up and keep where we can find them.
What do you think?</p>

<p>So I tried to call <b>Beth Miller</b>. You remember Beth, don't you? She was gonna
update the list and mail it out once or twice a year, according to the letter she sent out
after the reunion. You might also recall that she said in that letter that she was engaged
to Dennis Loubet. Well, it gets better. I called both <b>Karen Miller</b> and <b>Dave Rich</b>,
the keepers of all old Aggie Player information that are not named Beth Miller, and they
didn't have her number. So I called directory assistance in Round Rock and they gave me a
number, which I am tempted to publish her, but you can get it anyway if you try hard
enough. Anyway, I called Beth Miller, but this Beth didn't know what an Aggie Player was,
and wasn't the right person. Here's where it gets interesting. Round Rock isn't very big,
so I asked if there were a lot of Beth Millers in Round Rock, and she said that there was
one, but that she didn't know her, and that she (the Beth who isn't ours) thought that she
(the Beth who IS ours) had gotten married and then divorced, and was married to a guy
named John, and had most likely moved away, because she wasn't getting many call for our
Beth anymore. I'm reeling at that point. This anonymous world we've made has been bypassed
somehow, and this Beth Miller we don't know knows everything going on with the Beth Miller
that we know, and I began to wonder, how many wrong numbers has this Beth talked to that
she knows all of this about the mysterious other Beth that we know? What kind of a sicko
must this Beth who isn't ours be? Just the kind we like, I think. And who is John, and
where is Beth? And maybe they know something at Origin Systems....</p>

<p>The Theater Arts Section is being run by two commie pinko outsiders and two TAs. They
gang up on Coach and the senior staff and do things like close the Green Room and try to
disband the Aggie Players as anything but a student club. How many of you remember when we
started that club? The Aggie Players were already 30 years old by then... What are you
going to do about it?</font></p>
