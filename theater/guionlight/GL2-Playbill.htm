<p>So rumor has it that</font></b><font FACE="Impress BT"> ... <b>Tony Hall</b> wants to
have a reunion this summer. At <b>Nancye Gandy Gorman&#146;s</b> house in Houston. Nancye
asks that all interested parties contact Tony because if she&#146;s providing the house he
can do everything else, ok?</p>

<p>Aggie Players are e-mailing with the Big Guys. <b>Walt Meissner, Bruce Monroe, Chuck
Adams, and Beth Miller Loubet</b> have all exchanged electronic missives since the first
newsletter. Yes, Beth is back. I&#146;m crazy about her. If I delete the curse words, her
letter said, &quot;If you knew my address and my husband&#146;s name, why didn&#146;t you
just call?&quot; Well, I knew your old address, but I had a pretty low confidence level
that it was still your domicile, Beth. And I knew that you had been engaged to Mr Loubet,
but the other Beth Miller said that she heard that you were divorced, and I thought ...
well, we&#146;re glad we know how to find you now. Beth is still at Origin and they are
making GREAT computer games!</p>

<p>Bruce Monroe got a Christmas letter from Walt Meissner and replied to Walt&#146;s
E-mail address. Walt was kind enough to share it with me. Bruce is alive and well in our
nation&#146;s capital, and I&#146;m so glad to hear it!</p>

<p>Here are some E-mail addresses:</p>

<p>Walt Meissner <a href="mailto:wcs@bu.edu">wcm@bu.edu</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Beau Sharbrough <a href="mailto:beau@sharbrough.net">beau@sharbrough.net</a></p>

<p>I&#146;m not posting Beth&#146;s because she said that she is not supposed to get
unsolicited E-mail at work. Bruce hasn&#146;t indicated that publishing his is ok yet, so
I&#146;ll give it to you if you E-mail me. Some of you other guys with E-mail addresses
need to get out here and get on the list!</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jamie Craig</b> informs us that in Franklin, the only people who get E-mail are named
Elliot and Easterly. Ouch.</font></body>
