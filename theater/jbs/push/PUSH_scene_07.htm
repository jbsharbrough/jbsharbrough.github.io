<p>SCENE 7: Roger Faltry, alone, a Housecoat in a big house, drinking coffee &#133; He
sings</p>
<u>

<p>I Like This Housecoat<br>
<br>
</u>You know I like this housecoat, <br>
She gave me it last year,<br>
You know I like this housecoat,<br>
But I wish she was here,<br>
But I wish she was here.<br>
<br>
You know I love this kitchen,<br>
I eat here very well,<br>
You know I love this kitchen,<br>
But it can&#146;t take her place,<br>
But it can&#146;t take her place.<br>
<br>
I wish that I was dancing,<br>
Or riding on a cloud.<br>
I wish that I was dancing,<br>
But I wish she was near,<br>
But I wish she was here.<br>
<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<br>
You know I like this housecoat, <br>
She gave me it last year,<br>
It&#146;s warm, I like this housecoat,<br>
But I feel cold in here,<br>
But I feel old in here.<br>
