<p>SCENE 9: Larry&#146;s apartment. No one is onstage. It is early morning and Larry and
Ellen are still asleep. We hear the voice of Roger Faltry.</p>

<p>AN ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF, AND LARRY STUMBLES INTO THE LIVING ROOM AND CROSSES TO THE
DOOR, AND OPENS IT. HE GOES OUT AND ROGER COMES IN. LARRY COMES BACK IN WITH THE PAPER AND
A BOTTLE OF MILK. HE GOES BACK TO THE BEDROOM, AND ELLEN COME IN AND STARTS TO FIX SOME
TOAST AND COFFEE. ROGER STAYS AWAY FROM HER, AND WATCHER HER MOVE AROUND THE KITCHEN.
LARRY COMES IN AND SITS DOWN AT THE TABLE FOR HIS TOAST AND COFFEE.</p>

            MYSELF!!! I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. <u>You&#146;re</u> the one who
            should be worried. I don&#146;t think that you washed clothes more than once every 6 weeks
            before I came here. There were always dishes in the sink and roaches in the cabinet. I

SAY SOMETHING TO ELLEN, BUT JUST CLOSES IT. HE STARTS TO TOUCH HER, REACHES OUT, AND PULLS

            <p>!?!?! Roger? Roger? Oh, goodness, my mind is playing tricks on me. I&#146;m feeling
            Roger&#146;s hand. Roger&#146;s in California with Carol Wayne. He couldn&#146;t be here
            and there at the same time. Ellen&#146;s going crazy, Ellen&#146;s going crazy &#133;</p>
