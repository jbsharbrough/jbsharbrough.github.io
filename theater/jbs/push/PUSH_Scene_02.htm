    <p>Ellen, you need to make up your mind. The waiter is waiting on you.</p>

    <p>So what? He&#146;s a waiter, isn&#146;t he? Let the hungry jerk wait or we won&#146;t
    give him a tip.</p>

    <p>Roger! I&#146;m sorry, but I don&#146;t get to go out like this very often and I want
    to be sure that I&#146;ll remember what I got. I don&#146;t wanna eat the same stuff I get
    at home, you know.</p>

    <p>You <u>will</u> be eating at home if you don&#146;t make up your mind by the time I
    count to One. And you say that <u>I&#146;m</u> picky about food.</p>

    <p>Then I&#146;ll just eat whatever you eat. Who knows, if I eat it once in a while I
    might even look thinner.</p>

    <p>Waiter, we&#146;ll have the sirloin with a baked potato, medium, and Thousand Islands

    <p>Roquefort for the lady. And we&#146;ll drink wine, a red wine, choose it for us, if you
    will. We&#146;ll have coffee after the meal.</p>

    <p>I hate the way you say that, two and one. You just said it to spite me, didn&#146;t

    <p>No, you said you&#146;d have whatever I had. You said something about losing weight, I
    think.</p>

    <p>So you think I&#146;m fat, do you? You&#146;ve got a roll around your own tummy, you
    know. I felt it last week. You said you&#146;ve been out jogging to stay in shape, but
    I&#146;ll bet you&#146;ve been out drinking the whole time.</p>

    <p>You know I never said you were fat. I don&#146;t think that you&#146;re fat.
    You&#146;ve never been fat. You probably never will be fat. I wouldn&#146;t car if you
    were fat. You can get as fat as you want, I don&#146;t care if you get fat. I care that
    you talk all the time. I wish you&#146;d lose some weight between your teeth.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>Well, Roger, you never talk, and I never even know whether you&#146;re in the room or
    gone to bed or what. I talk to get you to talk because I don&#146;t know where you are. I
    wouldn&#146;t talk as much if you just touched me once in a while or said something,
    anything, just to let me know you&#146;re there. Is that asking too much, Roger? Just a
    little consideration?</p>

      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <p>I&#146;ve been thinking about talking and I think we have a major problem. I don&#146;t
    think we&#146;re compatible like we used to be. You used to be satisfied pretty easy,
    remember? Now, you don&#146;t even notice it, you gripe all the time. You never open your
    mouth without demanding or whining or correcting and I worry about it. Where the hell is
    that TV waiter? I&#146;m ready for my salad.</p>

    <p>The waiter works on TV?</p>

    <p>If you could see my face right now, you wouldn&#146;t be able to eat tonight. I know he
    doesn&#146;t work at a TV station, I know everything. And you know considerably less.
    You&#146;re really dumb sometimes, and I&#146;m just totally confused as to why.</p>

    <p>You don&#146;t have to be so rude to me. I know I&#146;m not as smart as you, Roger
    are, but I don&#146;t hold that against you. I like you because you&#146;re really funny
    when you&#146;re happy. You&#146;re just being mean to me because you&#146;re so smart and
    you&#146;re not doing anything. Well, you can just do it by yourself, because I&#146;m
    leaving and I&#146;ll see you at home. Take a taxi because I&#146;m taking the car.</p>

    <p>Ellen, please. You know how hard it is for me to get taxis &#133; what about dinner?
    &#133; well, you know &#133;.</p>
