<p><small>fade IN: USA, 1977. A slide show has been running, and it ends with a slide of a
city, then a street, then a house, and then the stage lights up and we are in the faltry
living room. </small></p>

<h1><small>SCENE 1: THE FALTRY LIVING ROOM</small></h1>

<p><small>The TV is on, and the Faltrys have just finished breakfast. He is smoking. It is
cold outside, cold and windy.</small></p>

<pre><small>ROGER SINGS &quot;CAROL WAYNE&quot; and TAKES A TAP BREAK)

always wanted to be on celebrity sweepstakes
and go out on the air, I swear
I’d answer every one, I’d have a lot of fun
but most of all I’d wanna sit by carol wayne

carol wayne, carol wayne, you’re the woman of my dreams
or so it seems when I see you play
you’re the sleeper in the crowd, oh, I know you’d make me proud
take me high, take me low, take me where you wanna go
I know it’s just a game, but I can’t help but wanna play

I’ve seen through your act, it’s invisible to me
when you act dumb on my TV
I’ve seen your front on my TV
would you let down your hair with me?
Would you let me see the woman
I know that is hiding
like me?

CHORUS, FOLLOWS BY TAP BREAK, SLOW TO FINISH</small></pre>
