<h1>Social Security for the New Millennium</h1>
<p><b>Proposal</b>: use a person's complete lifetime to retirement at age 65 to
maximize the compounded value of a small initial investment.&nbsp; How to
accomplish this for everyone?&nbsp; The government will loan $1000 to each
newborn at 5% interest. The loan to be paid off with 2% of the FICA tax.</p>
<p><b>Assumptions</b>: 10% annualized return from approved list of broad market
index funds only in a Roth-type IRA. At age 65 the $1000 should become
approximately $490,000. If the 2% FICA tax is added to the accumulation after
the loan is repaid the total should be about $530,000. This is assuming that the
person begins work at about age 19 at today's minimum wage and never makes more
than TODAY's minimum wage. The loan would be repaid at about age 34.</p>
<p><b>What about inflation?</b> Ibbotsen Associates predict annual 3.1%
inflation over the next 26 years. They also predict an S&amp;P total annualized
return of 11.6% - 1.6% above what we are using in our calculation. Our
assumption of no wage inflation in 65 years is extremely conservative and so the
combination of these two factors should render the actual accumulation values to
be at least equivalent to the above in terms of today's purchasing power.</p>
<p><b>What needs to be done?</b> This plan at least would require the
elimination of the earned income requirement for this retirement Roth IRA.
Congress would have to approve the $1,000/citizen loan which would amount to a
cost of about $4 billion/year (the present birth rate is about 3.9 million). As
the workers begin paying the FICA tax this cost would be driven down
drastically.</p>
<p>It would tend to eliminate elderly women living in poverty and it could be
made optional if too many want to keep their children with the present system.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any comments, negative as well as affirmative.</p>
